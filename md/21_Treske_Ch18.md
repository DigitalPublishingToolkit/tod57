BNC-MT is short for **BARBARIAN NON-CINEMATIC MEDIA THEORY**.

Video Theory Reboot. It is time for a call to action. We need to think
critically about the impact of technology on our lives and develop new
ways of understanding the world around us and new methods for
understanding this new culture. We need to find ways to make sense of
the vast amount of information available to us and their
infrastructures, and we need to find ways to connect with each other
meaningfully through alternative structures and spheres. We need new
practices and aesthetics.

This call is nothing new. Audiovisual, technological culture is
constantly changing. In 2015, in his book *Elegy for Theory* D.N.
Roderick stated:

> A new audiovisual culture, whose broad and indiscernible outlines we
> are only just beginning to distinguish, calls us to new modes of
> existence and forms of experience. Like any soul derailed by the
> vertiginous shock of modernity, we seek a conceptual compass to guide
> us home. One name for this navigational instrument is theory; another
> may be philosophy.[^21_Treske_Ch18_1]

There still needs to be a theory. Many theories are embedded in various
studies, grounded on objects, patterns, similarities, phenomena, fields,
themes, and genres, scientific communities with specific dialects,
algorithmic beliefs, disciplines like languages of different nations,
governing systems of knowledge and knowledge distribution. It appears
that *surgeons, generals, mothers, writers, chefs, archaeologists,
biologists, engineers, and seducers* have a preferred domain of objects,
and all constantly argue with one another about the relative importance
of these materials, but *we forget that they are the same size and that
nothing is more complex, multiple, real, palpable, or interesting than
anything else.*[^21_Treske_Ch18_2]

## dispositiv media theory

During the opening of the Media Archaeology Lab at Bilkent University in
Ankara in 2017, Wolfgang Ernst reminded me that we need to be precise,
accurate, which I interpret to mean focused on the target.

Ernst himself formulates a dispositive media theory, reminding us that
media are not neutral but rather *dispositifs* that shape how we
perceive and understand the world. Media can be used to both empower and
control people. Media theory can only be done with a deep understanding
of the technologies that produce and circulate media. Such a theory must
bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences. Technical
knowledge is essential for understanding materiality and impact.

Media theory needs a clear and precise definition of the media concept
to carry out its work effectively. This definition should be broad
enough to encompass all types of media. Yet it should also be specific
enough to be useful for analysis. A well-defined media concept is
essential for distinguishing between media and non-media and
understanding media's unique properties. Media theory must be open to
new approaches and perspectives and be willing to engage with other
disciplines to produce a comprehensive understanding of media and
audiovisual culture in the 21st century.

Any new theory needs to be a theory of lifeness. Lifeness is the
possibility of the emergence of new forms and the potential to generate
unprecedented connections and unexpected events.[^21_Treske_Ch18_3]

## Doing Things

We need a new strategy of *doing things with words* and *doing things
with things* or *doing things with visuals*. We need to stage
interventions across conventional boundaries. The new aesthetics needs
to operate simultaneously as a theory of production and reception. On
the production side, it needs to provide a framework for understanding
aesthetic work as the deliberate creation of relational atmospheres,
rather than isolated objects. On the reception side, it needs to reframe
our understanding of perception as a comprehensive experience of
presence—specifically, how we encounter and sense the immediate reality
of people, objects, and environments in their full dimensionality.

> In the twenty-first century, we’ve moved in a more challenging
> environment than that of the time when bodily perception was seen as
> extended by technological prosthesis, as Marshall McLuhan famously
> argued. Our post-pandemic sensory world is deeply pharmacological:
> toxic and curative, exciting and dangerous, a place where endless
> media saturation forces us to revisit ideas of life itself.[^21_Treske_Ch18_4]

We need to crash the party. We need to have fun. And we need to start to
tell different stories. Dance all night long.

> Schlage die Trommel und fürchte dich nicht,
>
> und küsse die Marketenderin!
>
> Das ist die ganze Wissenschaft,
>
> das ist der Bücher tiefster Sinn.[^21_Treske_Ch18_5]

It really doesn’t matter if we will tell this story over and over again,
as long as we run against the capital’s walls. This is needed to
survive. Remember Scheherazade.

> And the same significance can be seen in the reverse operation, in
> the expanding of time by the internal proliferations from one story to
> another, which is a feature of the oriental storytelling. Scheherazade
> tells a story in which someone tells a story in which someone tells a
> story, and so forth. The art that enables Scheherazade to save her
> life every night consists of knowing how to join one story to another,
> breaking off at just the right moment – two ways of manipulating the
> continuity and discontinuity of time. It is a secret of rhythm, a way
> of capturing time.[^21_Treske_Ch18_6]

It is also a way of understanding. Without understanding, we will
struggle to formulate any theory. But, we might not understand *it* at
all now. The Trojan horse is in place, if we only accept that we are
inside and not surrounded but a part of *it*. Understanding is
interconnected with practice. It will be the practice of the Barbarian,
the simple ignorance.

## Positive Barbarism

Walter Benjamin's concept of *positive barbarism* is one of his most
provocative and generative ideas for me, emerging from his observations
of cultural exhaustion and the possibilities for renewal in modernity.
The concept appears in his 1933 essay *Experience and Poverty*, where he
develops it as a response to what he saw as the crisis of tradition and
experience in modern life.

World War I in Europe had interrupted severely traditional forms of
experience and cultural transmission. The traumatic impact of
industrialized warfare, combined with rapid technological change, had
rendered many traditional forms of wisdom and experience seemingly
irrelevant or impossible to communicate. Positive barbarism, for
Benjamin, represents a radical strategic response to cultural
over-saturation. It involves embracing a kind of cultural poverty—not
out of necessity, but as a deliberate choice. This *barbarism* is
*positive* because it clears the ground for new forms of experience and
expression, unencumbered by the weight of tradition.

The positive barbarian is one who starts from scratch, makes do with
little, builds with limited means, values directness over complexity,
and embraces new technological possibilities. For Benjamin, positive
barbarism carries revolutionary potential. By clearing away the detritus
of traditional culture, it creates space for new forms of collective
experience, different modes of perception, novel social relations, and
alternative political possibilities

This *starting from zero* approach isn't about destroying culture per
se, but about creating conditions for genuine cultural renewal. The
positive barbarian, in Benjamin's vision, is not someone who destroys
culture out of ignorance or hatred, but someone who strategically
reduces cultural baggage to create space for new forms of experience and
expression. This figure remains provocative and potentially instructive
for contemporary attempts to imagine and create alternative futures.

Today, when we face multiple crises and when the weight of accumulated
cultural detritus often seems overwhelming, Benjamin's concept of
positive barbarism suggests that starting from less might allow us to
build something more sustainable, authentic, and collectively
meaningful.

## Practice, Practice

Human beings are fundamentally practicing creatures. Practice transcends
mere repetition or learning; it represents the essential mechanism
through which humans transform themselves. This concept forms the
cornerstone of what Peter Sloterdijk terms *anthropotechnics*,[^21_Treske_Ch18_7] the
various technologies humans employ to shape, cultivate, and ultimately
reinvent themselves.

Practice, as Sloterdijk defines it, is any operation that enhances the
practitioner's ability to perform that same operation again. This
seemingly simple definition carries deep implications for understanding
human nature and development. Whether in the realm of physical fitness,
spiritual devotion, or intellectual pursuit, practice serves as the
bridge between what we are and what we might become.

The scope of practice in Sloterdijk's framework is remarkably
comprehensive. It encompasses everything from the most concrete physical
exercises to the most ethereal spiritual disciplines. Modern gym
culture, with its regulated routines and measured progressions, stands
alongside ancient ascetic traditions. Professional training programs
share conceptual space with meditation practices. What unites these
diverse activities is their transformative intent: their aim to overcome
perceived human limitations and reach toward something higher.

This vertical tension—the constant striving upward—characterizes all
meaningful practice. When religious frameworks provided clear paths to
transcendence, this manifested as spiritual exercise. In our secular
age, it emerges in different forms: the athlete pushing toward peak
performance, the entrepreneur pursuing excellence, or the artist
refining their craft. Yet the essential pattern remains: deliberate,
self-directed effort aimed at transformation.

Crucially, Sloterdijk distinguishes between two forms of repetition in
human life. The first is the mindless repetition of daily routine—the
mechanical cycling of habits without purpose or progress. The second is
deliberate practice—conscious, focused repetition aimed at growth and
transformation. This distinction helps us understand why some repetitive
activities lead to profound change while others merely maintain the
status quo.

Perhaps most provocatively, Sloterdijk argues that what remains vital in
religion today is not its belief systems but its practices—the
technologies it developed for reshaping human thought and feeling.
Modern society, rather than being post-religious, might better be
understood as having inherited and secularized these ancient practices
of self-transformation. Today's proliferation of training regimens, both
physical and metaphysical, suggests that the human need for
transformative practice persists, even as its expressions evolve.

The fundamental message is clear: humans are beings who must actively
work on themselves through practice to achieve their potential. This
work isn't optional or superficial—it's the very essence of human
development. Whether through physical discipline, mental training, or
spiritual exercise, practice remains the primary tool through which
humans shape themselves and, by extension, their world.

This understanding of practice does not see humans as fixed entities. It
rather presents us humans as works in progress, constantly engaged in
the project of self-transformation through deliberate practice.

## Things Strange

We have learned about networks, social connectivity, people and
relationships, communication processes, mobility, information and
capital flows, and network societies as the dominant social
organizational structure in the age of globalization. People and objects
are equal. Objects can determine reactions and act like people. Moments
of actions. The short life and constantly newborn relations in
repetition building.

The situation resembles an ecological system, an environment with
climatic conditions. The social is the result of a technological
formation. Modern technical media create an environment where data flows
like living organisms, governed by digital rules - codes, protocols, and
formats - that shape how information interfaces with human users. This
digital ecosystem doesn't exist in isolation from society; rather,
social interactions are transformed into inputs and outputs within these
information flows.

Both human activity and data exchanges exist within a framework defined
by technological capabilities, economic forces, and political
structures. These systemic constraints shape our communication ecology
much as climate shapes natural environments. However, this analogy has
its limits. While natural ecosystems can occasionally influence their
climate, the relationship between technical systems and their
constraining conditions tends to be more one-directional.

To understand modern communication, we must examine both the technical
infrastructure that enables data flow and the broader conditions that
shape how we use these systems. It is a complex interplay between human
society, digital information, and the structures that govern their
interaction.

## And so …

What makes it worth talking about video, online video or the *Visual*?
Its primary origin is a signal from a point of light moving, a dot
creating a line, and then building a shape in time and repeating. The
signal creates an environment spread in time and flow, and builds
information through information of a location, a point, a plane, a
status in time, bright or loud, a point somewhere and its data, a scan,
a mode, or something.

In Nam June Paik's view, the camera is just a tool for processing
information flows. It captures something (input) and sends it out
(output) in real-time. What makes video unique is this constant
exchange. We take a flow, manipulate it, and release it into the stream
for further transformation.

Paik argues that video is more about interaction than observation. It's
like being a sculptor or painter, working directly with the image rather
than passively watching it. Unlike film, which emphasizes storytelling,
or television, which focuses on consumption, video invites
participation. Video even foreshadows the rise of virtual images. We
criticize television's impact, but video offers something distinct:
liveness. This *real-time* quality gives video a unique ontological
presence, a way of being that sets it apart from other media.

> Live TV is like life, you never manage to get everything done, there
> are always a few bittersweet regrets. . . . But what is the interest
> in being live? Interactive events must happen live. We’d like to use
> interactive TV because the best use you can get from a TV is to answer
> it like a telephone.[^21_Treske_Ch18_8]

Video goes beyond simply communicating messages and fostering social
connections. It creates a new way of experiencing time. Unlike
traditional media that capture a moment in time, video puts us right in
the middle of the action. With video, we don't just witness an event, we
participate in its construction. This happens through a collective
process, where different elements (like technology and people) come
together to create a flow of experience. Live video technology even
changes how we think about ourselves as viewers. Joseph Beuys captured
this well when he said, *I am a transmitter and I radiate.* He wasn't
just saying he's involved; he meant he becomes part of the ongoing flow
himself, connected to countless others. This opens up entirely new
social and artistic possibilities, all centered around this idea of
continuous, ever-changing experience.

Forget fixed images and pre-defined moments. Video lets us build time
together as a collective flow.

Perhaps it is in this sense that we should interpret another statement
from Paik: ‘The ultimate goal of the video revolution is the
establishment of space-to-space communication, from situation to
situation and not from subject to subject . . . we no longer work on an
object, but a situation.’[^21_Treske_Ch18_9]

Video technology, with its ability to handle any situation, allows the
world to truly become a realm of moving images, of *Visuals*, as
envisioned by Bergson.[^21_Treske_Ch18_10]

Let’s make things strange again. Ostranenie. Videoness!

BNC-MT shall be a theory of environments, of habitats where signals flow
and social practices take place. Media is faces and places, or figures
and spaces. Media theory is about environments and infrastructures as
much as about messages and content. We need to think of media as
environmental, as part of the habitat.

Nothing is pure, but everything is new.

## Sight Seeing / MOVING

Travel isn't just about going somewhere; it requires intention. We move
for a reason: work, necessity, or personal growth. Our journeys are
guided, following established routes or plans. Any non-work travel that
follows a defined path can be considered tourism.

Unlike consuming media, tourism is a physical experience. Tourists are
constantly on the move, physically traveling along routes, visiting
designated landmarks, and following pre-determined schedules. This
creates a routine. Deviations from these defined paths might be random
exploration (sightseeing) or something more unsettling: terrorism.

Tourists and terrorists both reach destinations different from their
starting points, but their motivations differ significantly.

Sightseeing expands the visitor's environment, allowing them to explore
a temporary location and its surroundings. Hiroki Azuma argues that
tourism shares similarities with a creative practice called *secondary
derivation*. In this process, fans (often *otaku*) take original works
and create new ones based on them. Similarly, tourists interact with
existing realities (destinations) and create their own experiences,
effectively making *secondary derivative works* out of reality.

There's a distinction between physical movement (like walking) and the
rapid exchange of information, which is another kind of movement.

In Peter Weibel's work, movement encompasses both. It includes the
physical movement of objects and bodies, the movement of thought, and
the constant flow of information. Weibel's perspective suggests there's
no such thing as something genuinely static. Everything is in a state of
flux, even our thinking.

‘There is nothing dead.’[^21_Treske_Ch18_11]

At the turn of the 20th century, travel was primarily a function of
power. Armies and resources moved in service of war and military
exercises. Ordinary travel remained a luxury for the privileged few. The
concept of the tourist emerged as a transformation of the industrial
worker. Increased leisure time, a byproduct of this era, became a
consolation prize for an otherwise grueling existence. The Nazi slogan
*Kraft durch Freude* exemplifies this idea. In a society like the one
depicted in Fritz Lang's *Metropolis*, factory workers might be offered
moments of controlled leisure—a brief escape from routine without any
real challenge to the system. Tourism is another structured element of
life, offering an illusion of freedom and choice without ever allowing
true liberation. The terrorist, in contrast to the tourist, operates
undercover. They enter the travel system similarly, but their actions
are disruptive and destructive.

Tourists and terrorists are the last moving human bodies at the moment
of writing this text. Anything else is things. And the soldier is
replaced by remote-controlled drones.

Hiroki Azuma, after wondering about the tourist, starts to reflect about
the concept of family. He writes: 
>The philosophy of the tourist must be
supplemented by the philosophy of the family. The strategy of the postal multitude that travels to and fro between nation state and Empire, spreading misdelivery and compassion, must be supported by a new
familial solidarity.[^21_Treske_Ch18_12]

Family resemblance is also a philosophical idea by Ludwig Wittgenstein.
Categories or concepts might not have one defining feature but a
collection of overlapping characteristics. Think of a family: some
members might have similar hair color, others share a height, but no
single feature defines everyone in the family.

Video is social. The Barbarian is never alone.
