The *swipe-down* mechanism, a pervasive interface design element, is
fundamentally altering human behavior and cognition. This seemingly
simple algorithm is reshaping our neural pathways and diminishing our
humanity by promoting compulsive behavior and instant gratification.

*Swipe culture* is the phenomenon of rapid-fire dating app matching,
made prevalent through platforms like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge. While
this culture has made dating seeming more accessible and efficient,
allowing users to quickly find potential matches based on their
preferences, it has also introduced social behavioral concerns. The
mechanism, used, by 2024, across social media platforms well beyond
dating apps (news sites, video platforms), is designed to keep users
continuously engaged by minimizing, quite literally, the need to lift a
finger from the screen. Companies deliberately implement this design to
maximize user engagement and screen time, resulting in unprecedented
levels of media consumption. The psychological impact is significant:
users become conditioned to expect immediate satisfaction and develop
shortened attention spans. This behavioral modification extends beyond
digital interfaces into real-life interactions, particularly in dating,
where people make snap judgments based on brief impressions. This
contributes to society's growing anxiety epidemic by keeping people in a
constant state of high stimulation.[^10_Treske_Ch7_1]

Interface design exploits and amplifies human compulsive tendencies.
While businesses benefit from increased engagement, users become trapped
in addictive patterns of behavior that reduce their capacity for deeper,
more meaningful interactions and thoughtful engagement with content.
This cultivates a society of reactive, impatient individuals whose
mental faculties are being diminished by constant exposure to this
mechanism of instant gratification.

Swipe culture contributes to problematic behaviors like *ghosting*. When
people abruptly cut off all contact with someone they've been dating or
talking to, it's known by several terms that paint different shades of
the same behavior. *Ghosting* is a sudden vanishing act: one day there,
the next gone without explanation. *Simmering* keeps things at a low
boil, occasionally responding just enough to keep the other person
hanging on. *Icing* puts the relationship into deep freeze, deliberately
ignoring someone while leaving the possibility of future contact
dangling.

These behaviors share a common thread: avoiding direct communication
about ending a relationship by simply disappearing, leaving the other
person wondering what happened. While technology makes it easier than
ever to stay connected, it also makes it surprisingly simple to vanish
from someone's life with the tap of a *block* button, or by simply never
opening their messages again. This common kind of relationship exit
strategy leaves the person on the receiving end without closure or
understanding of what went wrong. Instead of having potentially
uncomfortable conversations about why things aren't working out, people
choose to fade away into digital silence.

In swipe culture, people are likely to invest less time and energy in
building relationships with negative impacts on commitment.

And the emergence of short-form video content and short-form video
applications (SVA) has fundamentally contributed and transformed the
social media landscape. The way young people interact with online
content is affected by short-term video. The continuous video feed
scrolling has become deeply embedded in daily social behavior.

TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels have dramatically shifted
the video content ecosystem. This represents a significant departure for
YouTube, which traditionally dominated the long-form video market. While
long-form videos previously offered clear monetization opportunities
through multiple ad placements and brand collaborations, the shift to
short-form content has somehow created a paradoxical situation: despite
increasing viewer time spent on platforms, content creators face greater
challenges in generating revenue due to reduced advertising
opportunities. Audience viewing preferences and behavior patterns have
changed radically.[^10_Treske_Ch7_2]

## connect, create, and capture

Essentially we are experiencing video today in more or less three
different ways, each with its own personality and rhythm. First, there's
the addictive world of TikTok and Instagram Reels; it’s like flipping
through a magical deck of cards on your phone, each one packed with
music, filters, and quick cuts. Videos are bite-sized snacks, gone in
seconds, but somehow you keep finding more and more. It's a world where
anyone can remix anything, and new trends spread like wildfire.

Then there’s the cozy campfire of live streaming, where you can settle
in for the long haul. Creators and viewers share real moments together,
complete with technical hiccups and unscripted surprises. It's less
about perfect edits and more about building genuine connections. Live
streaming can be thought of as the digital equivalent of hanging out
with friends, where inside jokes flourish and communities grow stronger
with each stream.

And then there is the silent sentinel of surveillance video—the watchful
eye that never blinks. Unlike its more social cousins, this form of
video isn't about entertainment or connection. It's the patient
observer, storing endless hours of footage, quietly analyzing patterns
and waiting for something noteworthy to happen (as described before).

What is fascinating, somehow, is how each of these video forms has
carved out its very own niche. Each is like a different language in the
visual world: TikTok speaks in rapid-fire bursts of creativity, live
streams flow like long conversations, and surveillance footage whispers
in the language of record-keeping. The way we engage with each one is
completely different, from the quick dopamine hits of short-form content
to the slow burn of a favorite streamer's broadcast.

These distinct cultures show us just how versatile video has become;
it’s not just about watching anymore, but about how we connect, create,
and capture our world in vastly multiple ways.

## Gestures in Time

There is a text by Giorgio Agamben, *Notes on Gesture*; it is the last
chapter of *History & Infancy*, a concise piece. It’s also fascinating.
He tells about an exciting symptom recorded by physicians at the end of
the 19th century: the loss of gestures among urban (bourgeois) people,
people forgetting manners of walking or experiencing disorders
(uncontrollable jerking, etc.) while making simple everyday gestures. He
says that with the start of the 20th century, this issue was no longer
noted. Not only, says Agamben, because this state became *normal,* but
also because of the rise of a *machinery of gestures.* Following
Deleuze, Agamben calls cinema a production of gestures—blocks of space
and movement, which are basically gestures. So, one loss of gestures was
replaced by another kind of gesture production.

The state Agamben describes before the turn of century is a state of
alienation, a response of the body when one suddenly falls into another
form of life. The stranger forgets how to walk, how to move his hands,
how to point and how to look.

> I’m living in this newly gentrified area, you know, which is an old
> immigrant neighborhood now invaded by mostly white young artists,
> students and yuppies. And I observe their manners and gestures, which
> are incredibly interesting; some sort of very much individualistic set
> of expressions, but highly stylized manners which are never original,
> or natural at all; an expressive explosion, as opposed to an

> side, the immigrants.[^10_Treske_Ch7_3]

We observe that every repeated action we perform shapes who we are and
influences our future behavior, from the second time onward. This means
there's no such thing as an insignificant repeated gesture. During the
Enlightenment, this understanding of repetition took on new
significance: people realized that the world's continuity depends on
these patterns of repetition. This isn't an argument against unique
events, but rather a criticism of how we overly romanticize the concept
of uniqueness. Both nature and culture function as systems built on
repetition. Even in religious terms, this concept holds true—divine
power primarily works through nature's established patterns, with
miracles being rare exceptions. Kierkegaard captured this modern
understanding when he proposed that repetition is fundamental to
existence itself; without God willing repetition, there would be no
world. The world exists through and consists of these patterns of
repetition. Nietzsche extended this thinking through his
self-experimentation, suggesting that style, which he saw as the
cultural expression of repetition, is the essence of a person. Someone
who truly understands style sees happiness not as random occurrences but
as a cultivated habit of being happy.

The key insight is that repetition isn't just mechanical reproduction;
it’s the fundamental pattern that shapes both our world and ourselves.

## Windows of Interaction

I like to imagine gestures as a language that speaks through
movement—not just any movements, but those that carry meaning and
intention. Such movements can be more than just physical actions. For
example, Vilem Flusser viewed them as windows into how we express
ourselves and interact with our world.[^10_Treske_Ch7_5]

Consider how writing has evolved: from the flowing motion of handwriting
to the tapping of keys, and now to *this smooth swipe* of a finger
across a screen. Each change in technology transforms not just how we
move, but how we think and express ourselves. These technological shifts
reshape our gestural vocabulary. In the world of smartphones and dating
apps, the simple swipe has become a powerful gesture that would have
intrigued Flusser. This single movement now carries the weight of
complex social decisions—acceptance or rejection, interest or
disinterest—all compressed into a quick slide of the finger. It's both
liberating in its simplicity and constraining in its binary nature.

It is amazing how quickly these new gestures become second nature.
Swiping has developed its own cultural language: a swipe right means one
thing on Tinder, while a swipe up means something else on Instagram.
These movements, though simple, reflect profound changes in how we
interact with information, each other, and our world. The swipe gesture
represents an extreme simplification of human judgment and interaction.
What should be complex social, emotional, or intellectual decisions are
reduced to binary, split-second movements. This reduction mirrors what
Theodor Adorno might call the *standardization of consciousness*, where
nuanced human experience is flattened into predetermined patterns. The
swipe interface isn't neutral—it’s designed to maximize engagement and
data collection. The gesture becomes a behavioral conditioning mechanism
where users are trained to make rapid and emotional, rather than
contemplative, decisions. The physical pleasure of the smooth swipe
motion is paired with variable reward schedules. The endless feed
structure creates what Jonathan Crary calls *24/7 capitalism*, where
even our gestures are captured in cycles of continuous consumption.

## Embodied Alienation

As we repeatedly swipe through endless content, our bodies become like
machines—our fingers dancing to the rhythm of algorithms, our touch
transformed from an intimate human gesture into data points for tech
companies to collect.

Time itself seems to bend. We're caught in what feels like an endless
present, where thoughtful reflection gives way to split-second
decisions. It's as if we're racing through a digital landscape at
breakneck speed, barely processing one piece of content before moving to
the next.

Though we're supposedly more connected than ever, there's an ironic
loneliness to it all. Each of us sits alone, swiping through our
personalized content streams, our relationships increasingly measured in
likes and matches rather than genuine human moments. While we feel we're
making choices, we're actually moving through carefully designed
pathways, each swipe feeding data to invisible systems that learn our
patterns and preferences.

Perhaps most profound is how this simple gesture is rewiring our
thinking. Complex decisions become binary choices: left or right, like
or dislike. We're training ourselves to react rather than reflect, our
attention scattered across an endless stream of fleeting moments. It's a
shift that goes beyond just changing how we use technology; it’s
changing how we think, feel, and connect with the world around us.

Fig. 7. META-SCHAUEN OBSCUR

The fundamental event of the modern age is the conquest of the world as
picture. The word *picture* *(Bild)* now means the structured image (*Gebild*) that is the
creature of man's producing which represents and sets before. In such producing, man contends for
the position in which he can be that particular being who gives the measure and draws up the
guidelines for everything that is.[^10_Treske_Ch7_6]

In *Du Mode d’Existence des Objets Techniques(On the mode of existence
1958)*, Simondon showed us a new approach to the understanding of
*technical objects*, and rethought the relation between humans and machines, cultures and technologies. Today we are
witnessing the proliferation of types of object – digital objects in
particular – while the very notions of object and objectivity are being transformed by digitizing processes.

This has inevitable implications for experiences and concepts of
subjectivity, …[^10_Treske_Ch7_7]
