# LOG:: 11 Light wants crystal

> …the new environment \[that\] . . . must bring with it a new culture.
>
> —Paul Scheerbart

Glass. It is not plastic. The object might feel like it, but it's not
made of plastic. Historically it had been, with smaller screens embedded
in a case made of plastic and metals. But now, digital devices have
become full screen with less non-screen placed on the front side of the
thin rectangular hand-sized object. All screen: to see, to touch.

Glass material is durable, scratch-resistant, and, most importantly,
touch-sensitive. New materials like Gorilla Glass provide excellent
display clarity, enhance visibility, minimize distortions, allow for
solid and easy touch interaction on screen, enhance durability, and
actually protect against daily usage—pocket in, pocket out, scratching
and crashing, ohh, accidental drops. Glass also added style and visual
appeal to the viewing experience.[^15_Treske_Ch12_1]

The object became *sleek* and *modern*. Aesthetic appeal pushed for
round edges and seamless finishes, generating fashion accessories with
changing skins fitting outfits and handbags. Manufacturers using the
transparency of glass experiment with colors and textures to provide an
increasing amount of design options and personalization. Glass's smooth,
reflective surface adds a touch of sophistication and elegance. You
carry the object with you as a statement of you.

Like many cities in the world, since the 2010s, Ankara's look has
changed. Along the main roads, high-rises with reflecting glass surfaces
have been built one after another. The glass curtain facade has been the
representative standard for office buildings and skyscrapers for
decades. More or less, they have a uniform appearance in cities
worldwide; glass stands for the confidence of capital.

Contemporary glass architecture also gives us some idea about the
possibilities of the material glass. Building glass is coated with a
thin wash of color or stained, printed, lacquered, laminated, and used
in conjunction with many other materials. Transparency and translucency
vary in different forms. The crystalline character reappears with
colorful shapes, broken surfaces, and asymmetries. In darkness and when
lit from the inside, some buildings appear to be made simply of
light.[^15_Treske_Ch12_3] Glass pushes color to the foreground; translucency allows
matte glass walls, playful illusionary settings of spaces, and exchanges
between variations of interiors. Moreover, a glass surface is alive
through light reflection and mirror effects.

Manufacturers like Zeiss are producing new multifunctional *Smart Glass*
materials, which offer transparent holographic displays, enabling
spatial computing as promoted by the latest personal VR, AR, and XR
devices.[^15_Treske_Ch12_4] Initially developed for space flight, the technology
enables new lighting, display, projection, filtering, and touch
detection. Glass is combined with transparent plastic surfaces,
micro-optical structures, and holographic optical elements. This
technology enables head displays for automobiles and aircraft,
displaying augmented-reality overlays of vehicle status for the driver
or pilot. The glass material can power holographic cameras and
transparent displays with projected keyboards. Wherever glass is used,
this technology can add a digital layer on any otherwise transparent
surfaces, such as windows of buildings, screens, and side windows of
vehicles, forming multiple imaginable usages. They are becoming
on-demand communication screens. A layer is generated within a thin,
transparent layer, sandwiched between glass sheets, to which
ultra-high-precision optics are attached. Car windows might only be the
start. The technology enables fluent switches in cockpits and smart home
applications. It also allows direct eye contact between people in
videoconferences by placing a transparent camera in the middle of a
device's screen.

Glass is matter. It is light. Glass is immortal, and also fragile. Glass
can be viewed in terms of its many profound contradictions: at once firm
and delicate, solid and liquid, and formed of sand and ash, being of the
earth but appearing otherworldly in its chemical complexity, and in the
mysterious duality of its transparency: revealing and yet veiling,
altering perceptions.

Glass can be transparent and translucent. You cannot see clearly through
translucent material, as it has a blurry surface. Translucent
construction in architecture acknowledges the separation of exterior and
interior. Using subtle manipulations of visual perception, the ambiguity
between the two realms is often the primary field of inquiry. It
accompanies the interruption of space flowing across the exterior
boundary of the building's spaces and its physical structure at its
exterior face. The American architect and curator Terence Riley
characterized this separation as a veil constituted by an imposed delay
in apprehension between viewer and space beyond: a *triggered
subjectivity*.[^15_Treske_Ch12_5]

## Transparency

The idea of in-betweenness is inseparable from glass. The material
exists at a threshold, chemically speaking, and the debate continues as
to whether glass is an amorphous solid or a super-cooled liquid. What is
clear, though, is that glass exists as a state between a liquid and a
solid. This means that despite having properties of both liquid and
solid, glass is neither. It is too dense to be a crystalline solid and
too cohesive in molecule structure to be a liquid.

In these glass-walled, *transparent* enclosures or environments, things
are not as they seem; reality becomes skewed. A general belief in the
transparent, vision-enabling properties of glass is evident in its
incorporation into optical devices such as glasses, magnifying lenses,
and camera lenses. However, early musings on the nature of glass allude
to its illusory qualities, linked only in part to seeing.

In the 1960s Colin Rowe and Robert Slutzky’s influential essays on
transparency set in motion critical discussion. 

>Transparency may be an
inherent quality of substance—as in a wire mesh or glass curtain wall,
or it may be an inherent quality of organization.[^15_Treske_Ch12_6]

Rowe and Slutsky distinguished between two senses of transparency:
literal, real transparency, and phenomenal, seeming transparency. Adrian
Forty added a third sense of transparency: transparency of meaning
(Adrian Forty, 2004).[^15_Treske_Ch12_7] Forty build upon Susan Sontag’s statement that
it should be clear that what is there should have no ambiguity between
form and contents. The truth of material must exhibit its character.

The myth of transparency has haunted modernity. We are obsessed with
everything being open and transparent: people revealing themselves to
nature and each other, and society knowing everything about everyone.
This transparency is often on display in buildings made of glass, where
spaces flow into each other and light and movement are everywhere. Glass
has always been more than just practical. It's been linked to fantasy,
myths, and utopian dreams. Legends about glass, like King Solomon's
palace, which was built of glass and water, show how glass can be both
revealing and create illusions.

King Solomon used a glass floor to expose the Queen of Sheba's true
nature. He wanted to know if she was a real woman or a genie (said to
have hairy legs). The Queen, tricked by glass that looked like water,
lifted her skirt to avoid getting wet, revealing her human legs. This
story perfectly shows the paradox of glass architecture: it tells the
truth through an illusion, truth and myth in the appearance of glass
itself.[^15_Treske_Ch12_8]

Leandro Erlich's *Swimming Pool*,[^15_Treske_Ch12_9] first created in 1999, is an art
installation with a glass floor permanently housed at the 21st Century
Museum of Art in Kanazawa, Japan, with past temporary exhibits at
MoMAPS1 and the Venice Biennale. The installation creates an optical
illusion of a filled swimming pool through a very clever design:
visitors above look down to see people walking at the bottom of what
appears to be a water-filled pool, while those below experience the
effect of being underwater through a glass ceiling with a thin layer of
flowing water above it. The piece includes typical pool features like a
ladder, allowing visitors to interact with the installation and
experience the underwater illusion while remaining dry.

In medieval stories, glass symbolized pure, honest love. By the 1800s,
its reflective nature made glass a symbol of self-absorption and the
path to understanding oneself and changing. Paul Scheerbart's 1913
manifesto, *Glass Architecture*, envisioned a future filled with
magnificent glass buildings on mountaintops bathed in colorful light. He
believed glass architecture could create a utopian world, protected from
harm and shining brightly. Paul Scheerbart and the architect Bruno Taut
dreamed up a utopian architectural style based on extensive use of
glass. This vision, largely unrealized, is slowly gaining recognition as
a forgotten strand of Modern Architecture.

Scheerbart and Taut, however, saw their *Glass Architecture* as an
inheritor to the Gothic cathedral. They admired how stained Glass in
cathedrals created a unique atmosphere, filtering light and hinting at a
heavenly realm. This artistic manipulation of light, they believed,
could elevate people morally. Scheerbart even argued that daily exposure
to beautiful glass would make people better! He saw it as more than
decoration, but as a powerful force for good.

> Paul Scheerbart viewed glass architecture as instead offering the
> possibility for a new cosmopolitan spirituality and a transcendent
> connection to nature. Glass, for Scheerbart, embodied the metaphoric
> potentiality of color and light, and the crystal was the natural form
> that symbolized these ideals. In Glass Architecture, he dreamt of
> buildings that were anti monumental, always changing, never the
> same.[^15_Treske_Ch12_10]

Unlike many early modernist buildings that aimed to reveal the true
nature of things, Glass in Taut's work wasn't about transparency but
about creating an illusion of another, dreamlike reality. Instead of
using glass to maximize light and create open spaces like the modernist
architect Loos, Taut focused on colored glass and light. This wasn't
about letting in more light, but bathing the space in a softer, colored
light that filtered through the colored glass, creating gentler, more
muted experience.

Only some of what's clear is genuinely transparent. Artists like Taut
and Scheerbart believed colored glass could improve society, not plain
glass. The word *transparent* itself has been misused, confusing how
glass reveals the world. Historically, from ancient to modern
architects, glass's symbolic meaning goes beyond its physical clarity.
Glass can be invisible (like windshields or screens) and distort reality
(like in scientific instruments). Even in modern architecture, perfect
transparency is a myth, and glass can also represent hope for humanity.
Buildings like Libeskind's Freedom Tower use glass not for its clarity
but for its ghostly reflection and the way it creates a sense of
absence. This reflects postmodern ideas of space and embodies the
utopian vision of glass in a contemporary way.

We're bombarded with the idea that everything should be transparent:
open, accountable, readily available. This ideal is especially pushed
online, where transparent screens and easy access are the keys to a
better world. But is transparency all it's cracked up to be? The dark
side of transparency is the constant feeling of being watched (*black
boxes*), the overwhelming amount of information (*black transparency*),
and the frustration of unclear communication (finger smudges, bad
connections).

## VIOLENT OPAQUE

Instead of striving for perfect transparency, the art project by
Malaysian curator Ray Tat and Gabriel de Sita *VIOLENT OPAQUE* proposes
embracing the messiness of communication. It focuses on the *opaque*
aspects of our digital world—things that are unclear, uncertain, and
frustrating. This *violence* isn't physical, but rather the emotional
impact of unclear communication. Examples of *VIOLENT OPAQUE* are the
frustration of a blurry video call, the uncertainty of who you're
talking to online, and the feeling of being watched without knowing
who's watching. The project argues that by acknowledging the messiness
of communication, we can have a more realistic understanding of our
digital world.[^15_Treske_Ch12_11]

When information is readily available, according to Byung-Chul Han,
societies rely less on trust and more on control. Transparency doesn't
build trust; it creates a system of constant monitoring. With instant
communication everywhere, long-term planning becomes difficult because
everything needs immediate attention. The continuous flow of information
makes it harder to disagree or have different opinions. Transparency
pressures everyone to conform. Transparency is a tool a neoliberal
economic system uses to turn everything into data that can be
controlled. Transparency overexposes people, making them vulnerable. It
seems like freedom but leads to constant surveillance, as in social
media becoming Bentham's panopticon. Transparency is an idea that sounds
good on the surface, but when taken too far, becomes dangerous and
controlling. In our fast-paced world, there's no room for privacy or
reflection. This constant flow of information and communication disrupts
everything.[^15_Treske_Ch12_12]

Our society prioritizes constant display and image over substance.
Everything is judged by its *exhibition value*, meaning its ability to
be seen and consumed. This continuous display has a pornographic
quality, where everything is exposed and devoid of hidden depths. This
system thrives on *attention capital*, where the more attention
something gets, the more valuable it becomes. This leaves no room for
*dwelling* or appreciating things on their terms. There's only the
pressure to be constantly showing off and seeking validation. In this
culture of exhibition, only the visible matters. The *invisible*,
anything that doesn't generate attention or fit the mold of the constant
display, is deemed unimportant. This creates a society obsessed with
external appearances without any inner depth or meaning. 
>Everything
must become visible. The imperative of transparency suspects everything
that does not submit to visibility. Therein lies its violence.[^15_Treske_Ch12_13]

Images designed to be easily grasped (exhibition value) lack complexity.
They are so clear that they become like pornography: obvious and lacking
any challenge that might make you think, no brokenness, nothing to
reflect upon. Further, faster communication comes at a cost. It
simplifies things to speed them up, sacrificing depth for speed. This
*anesthetic hypercommunication* ignores the senses, which are slower but
would be more prosperous. Transparency, then, means a lack of sensory
experience.

Transparency wants to eliminate all distance, making everything readily
available. However, this destroys true closeness. Real proximity
requires space for contemplation, which is impossible when everything is
constantly in your face. This *tactile perception* eliminates the beauty
of observing and reflecting. Transparency removes all sense of distance,
creating a uniform state that's neither close nor far.

Pleasure requires some mystery. Transparency strips information bare,
making it uninteresting and flat. While sometimes seen as negativity to
be banished, mystery is a valuable cultural tool. It creates symbolism
and depth, even if it is unclear.

In essence, technology acts as an extension of our senses and nervous
system. Cameras capture what we see, and digital media reflects our
thoughts and emotions. Social media, in particular, reveals the
unconscious aspects of society as a whole. The digital world totalizes
algorithms, calculations, and accumulation. It takes existing forms of
communication, like pictures and movies, and makes them adaptable and
endlessly reproducible.[^15_Treske_Ch12_14]

## Crystal Palace

The 1851 *Great Exhibition* showcased a significant shift in British
society. The focus moved from aristocracy and beauty to the middle class
and industry. Notably, the *Crystal Palace*, a giant glass and iron
building filled with global products, embodied this change. Following
Walter Benjamin, Hiroki Azuma compares it to an arcade, a space for
leisurely browsing. This aligns with the idea of the tourist as a
*flâneur*, someone who casually wanders and observes. The tourist, as a
contemporary figure, like a window shopper, is drawn by chance
encounters and discoveries, sometimes uncovering things locals might
prefer hidden. This *drifting* nature is critical to understanding
tourists. It has both limitations and potential for exploration.[^15_Treske_Ch12_15]

> Moreover, the image of the arcade and that of the Crystal Palace is
> also deeply related to nineteenth-century political thought. It is
> well known that the great imaginative socialist Charles Fourier used
> the arcade as a model for designing the building for his ideal
> community of phalanges. In other words, Fourier saw the shopping mall
> as a utopia, or at least thought it could serve as a foundation for
> such a utopia. The emergence of the arcade, a new space for
> consumption where a new class of people supported by new industries
> and new technologies congregate, provided a new utopian image for
> contemporary socialists.[^15_Treske_Ch12_16]

Fyodor Dostoevsky's novella *Notes from the Underground* criticizes the
future vision of another writer, Nikolai Chernyshevsky. A key symbol in
this critique is the *Crystal Palace*. Chernyshevsky saw the *Crystal
Palace* as a model for a future society. This society would be wealthy
and comfortable, with people living in beautiful, modern structures.
Dostoevsky's *Underground Man* hates this idea. He calls the *Crystal
Palace* a *chicken coop* because it represents a world without room for
rebellion or individuality. People would be stuck in a perfect, boring
society, unable to express anger. The *Crystal Palace's* focus on
technology and consumption as the path to happiness disgusts the
*Underground Man*.

Two opposing visions of the future are confronted. The Utopian Dream is
a future filled with connection, shared experiences, and potentially
even freedom from work thanks to technology. This vision is similar to
ideas of utopian socialism and the *Californian Ideology*. It reflects
the concept of a globally unified humanity, achieving *the unity of
mankind*. Dostoevsky's character, the Underground Man, rejects this
utopian dream entirely. He doesn't care about technological advancements
or the homogenization of the world through consumerism. The Underground
Man's rebellion isn't about the specifics of the utopia but the very
idea itself. He believes humans have the right to be unhappy,
irrational, and even *cringeworthy*. He sees forced happiness as a loss
of his individuality and humanity.

*The Underground Man* becomes the archetype for those who reject a
future of forced happiness and sameness, valuing the right to experience
suffering and individuality over a comfortable but uniform existence.

## Arcades

Walter Benjamin notes, reflecting on the arcades of Paris, that a
society lost in dreams doesn't learn from the past. Everything seems
both wholly new and repetitive. Even the feeling of something being
cutting-edge is a dreamlike distortion, like the idea of everything
eternally repeating. Their perception of time is chaotic and layered,
just like their perception of space. Once this society becomes
conscious, they start categorizing things based on political and
religious ideas. These categories act as a filter, slowing down the
constant flow of events and form history. Just as a crystal formation
captures light, these categories capture the flow of time. Similar to
how a full stomach doesn't directly influence the dreams of a sleeper,
the economic situation doesn't directly appear in a society's dreams.
However, it does get interpreted and reflected in their dreams. When
they wake up, they can finally understand the true meaning behind those
dreamlike interpretations.

Unlike artistic creations, technological advancements succeed when their
social impact is clear and easy to understand. This is why things like
glass architecture are successful - they are transparent in their
purpose. These early shopping malls were a forerunner of modern
department stores. They were built during a time that Balzac described
as a period of extravagant displays. Filled with luxury goods, these
arcades blurred the line between art and commerce. Everyone admired
them, and they became a major tourist attraction. Described as miniature
cities, these glass-roofed walkways offered a luxurious shopping
experience under the first gas lights.[^15_Treske_Ch12_17]

> The second condition for the emergence of the arcades is the
> beginning of iron construction. The Empire saw in this technology a
> contribution to the revival of architecture in the classical Greek
> sense. … Empire is the style of revolutionary terrorism, for which the
> state is an end in itself. Just as Napoleon failed to understand the
> functional nature of the state as an instrument of domination by the
> bourgeois class, so the architects of his time failed to understand
> the functional nature of iron, with which the constructive principle
> begins its domination of architecture. These architects design
> supports resembling Pompeian columns, and factories that imitate
> residential houses, just as later the first railroad stations will be
> modeled on chalets. Construction plays the role of the subconscious.
> Nevertheless, the concept of engineer, which dates from the
> revolutionary wars, starts to gain ground, and the rivalry begins
> between builder and decorator, Ecole Poly technique and Ecole des
> Beaux-Arts.[^15_Treske_Ch12_18]

For the first time in the history of architecture, an artificial
building material appeared: iron. It undergoes an evolution whose tempo
accelerates. The rail becomes the first prefabricated iron component.
Iron is used in arcades, exhibition halls, and train station buildings
that serve transitory purposes. At the same time, the range of
architectural applications for glass expands. However, the social
prerequisites for its widened application as a building material will
come to the fore only a hundred years later. In Scheerbart's
*Glasarchitektur* (1914), it still appears in the context of
*utopia*.[^15_Treske_Ch12_19]

As a new way of producing things emerges, people imagine a future shaped
by the new and the old. These visions are like wishes, reflecting a
desire to overcome limitations while holding onto familiar aspects. At
the same time, they push away anything outdated, even the recent past.
This yearning for something new can sometimes lead to a romanticized
version of the distant past, a time without social classes.

Inspired by the rise of machines, Charles Fourier envisioned a future
where people live together harmoniously, free from the moral corruption
of the business world. His phalanstery, a giant communal living space,
is described with intricate details that function like machinery but are
built with human passions and desires. This *human machine* creates a
paradise, a wish for a perfect society that echoes throughout history, a
heaven on earth.

Fourier took inspiration for his phalanstery from the arcades and
shopping centers he saw around him. He flipped their purpose,
transforming them from commercial spaces to places of residence. This
colorful, idyllic vision contrasted with the strict forms of his era.
Even later writers, like Zola, show the influence of Fourier's ideas,
even as they move away from the specific details of his utopia. Benjamin
points out the rise of panoramas. Panoramas, large-scale painted views,
marked a turning point. They emerged alongside the technological
advancements of iron and Glass construction, suggesting a move away from
traditional artistic forms. Panoramas aimed for extreme realism, using
techniques to depict changing light and movement. This focus on
capturing real-life details foreshadowed photography and film.

Parallel to this was a new type of literature mirroring panoramas.
Panoramas influenced a style of writing that presented snippets of life
and information, similar to how panoramas combined foreground details
with background landscapes. This literature also reflected social
changes, depicting the working class within a broader societal context.
Panoramas became a way for city dwellers to connect with nature,
bringing the countryside into the urban environment.

With his knowledge of lighting and scenic effects, the inventor of
photography, Louis Daguerre, collaborated with diorama painters from
1821 and owned himself a profitable diorama theatre in Paris. In 1839,
his panorama burned down. Daguerre was able to save his experiments,
daguerreotype specimens, notes, and equipment and publicly announced his
invention just a couple of months later: the daguerreotype.

## The Glass House

>To live in a glass house is a revolutionary virtue par excellence. It
is also an intoxication, a moral exhibitionism, that we badly need.
Discretion concerning one's own existence, once an aristocratic virtue,
has become more and more an affair of petit-bourgeois parvenus.[^15_Treske_Ch12_20]

*A lens in the landscape* is how the photographer Welling described
Philip Johnson’s glass house.[^15_Treske_Ch12_21] Philip Johnson, following the
footsteps of his mentor and collaborator Mies van der Rohe, writes about
his glass house:

> The multiple reflections on the 18’ pieces of plate glass, which seem
> superimposed on the view through the house, help give the glass a type
> of solidity; a direct Miesian aim which he expressed twenty-five years
> ago: I discovered by working with actual glass models that the
> important thing is the play of reflections and not the effect of light
> and shadow as in ordinary buildings.[^15_Treske_Ch12_22]

Johnson chose these words to accompany the most captivating photograph
in his pathbreaking 1950 essay detailing the influences on his new home.
The photograph of the north end of the west wall depicts Johnson reading
at his desk. More importantly, the giant pane of glass absorbs the
entire landscape and sweeps trees onto its reflective surface—what
Johnson irreverently referred to as *very expensive wallpaper*.

Modern architecture started as a broad movement with many goals. It
aimed to create a perfect society through innovative design and
technology, and its supporters avoided calling it a *style*. In 1920s
Europe, these architects believed in using honest materials (especially
glass, steel, and concrete) and letting the building's function
determine its form. They saw architecture as a way to improve society as
a whole. The one person who kept changing modern architecture from a
movement to a style was Philip Johnson. In 1932, Johnson, a young
curator at the Museum of Modern Art, helped introduce to American
audiences what he, together with Henry-Russel Hitchcock, called the
International Style. Both insisted on calling it a Style (with a capital
S). They also used other words like *contemporary* and *current*. This
switch to calling it a Style had a significant impact.

Johnson later reminisced about the publication that accompanied the
exhibition: 
>One of the points that the book made was a key one—that the Modern movement was a *style* similar to Gothic or Baroque, and it was that point which caused the objections from practicing architects.[^15_Treske_Ch12_23]

Johnson wouldn't become a practicing architect for a decade; he
eventually designed his own houses that perfectly embodied the
minimalist style of Mies van der Rohe. The houses—the Glass House and
the Brick House, completed in 1949 on his estate—could be seen as the
pinnacle of Modern architecture. However, this achievement also marked
the movement's decline. For Johnson, Modernism became just another
historical style from which to draw, as seen in his later architectural
works.

Modernism meant the negation of the past, an annihilation of history.
Early twentieth-century avant-gardes declared an absolute rupture with
the past. F. T. Marinetti spoke for many avant-garde artists when in
1909 he exclaimed: 
>Do you, then, wish to waste all your best powers in
this eternal and futile worship of the past, from which you emerge fatally exhausted, shrunken, beaten down?[^15_Treske_Ch12_24]

Johnson's Glass House—the structure and the estate—can be seen as one
attempt to redo modernism with a sense of history. This seems
contradictory. Nevertheless, the Glass House embodies a Modernism born
not of necessity, ideology, or functionality but rather of exhibitions
and books—in a word, history. Where Modernists fancied themselves
creators *ex nihilo*, Johnson's 1950 essay on the Glass House
enthusiastically cited source after source, from the Acropolis and Karl
Friedrich Schinkel to Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe.[^15_Treske_Ch12_25]

Johnson turned his estate into a personal museum, or in his words, the
*diary of an eccentric architect*. In a 1970 TIME Magazine article
entitled *The Duke of Xanadu at Home*, art critic Robert Hughes
emphasized that *most of all, in Johnson's view, people need a sense of
history.*[^15_Treske_Ch12_26]

> A traditional Modernist genealogy of the Glass House follows the
> bread crumbs left by Mies in his Farnsworth House (1945–51), through
> Pierre Chareau’s Maison de Verre (1928–32), all the way back to Joseph
> Paxton’s Crystal Palace (1851). One might add Walter Gropius’s Dessau
> Bauhaus (1925–26) or the Galérie des machines (1889) and the other
> great glass and iron constructions clustered around world exhibitions
> in the late nineteenth century. The story is the same. The maxim is
> light, air, openness—in a word, transparency.[^15_Treske_Ch12_27]

Johnson emphasizes a processional approach to architecture, where the
building unfolds and reveals itself gradually through movement and time.
The design of the approach road ensures visitors experience the full
depth of the Glass House from multiple angles, surpassing the experience
at the Acropolis, where visitors can only perceive three corners at
once. The diagonal approach reveals the building's depth in stages.
Johnson allows visitors to see all four corners through the transparent
structure.

However, Johnson's processional architecture is designed for a small,
elite audience, unlike the public experience of the Acropolis. With its
private studies and intimate tours, the Glass House estate resembles the
processional experience of 18th-century mansions, not the public
spectacle of modern architecture often celebrated.

## Light

At the heart of every smartphone, laptop, and modern electronic device
lies an invisible technological marvel that depends on light. While we
often think of light technology in terms of photography or architecture,
its most profound impact may be actually in the realm of semiconductor
manufacturing.

ASML in Veldhoven produces advanced chip-making
machines—photolithography machines which are used to produce computer
chips. ASML is partnering with Zeiss in Jena, which provides the
sophisticated optical systems essential to ASML's extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) lithography machines. These machines use incredibly precise light
patterns, projected through specialized lenses, to create the
microscopic circuits that power our digital world.

The process is akin to an ultra-precise form of photography, but at a
scale so small it challenges our imagination. Using light, these
machines pattern circuits onto silicon wafers, creating structures at
the nanoscale - thousands of times thinner than a human hair. This
light-based manufacturing process has become the foundation of modern
computing, enabling the creation of increasingly powerful chips.

The implications of this technology extend far beyond the clean rooms
where chips are manufactured. Every time we use a smartphone, start our
car, or interact with any modern appliance, we're relying on components
that were created by these machines. It's a reminder that while we often
focus on the digital nature of modern technology, its physical
foundation rests on our ability to harness and control light with
extraordinary precision.

> *Now objects perceive me*, the painter Paul Klee wrote in his Notebooks. This rather startling assertion has recently become objective fact, the truth. After all, aren't they talking about producing a *vision machine* in the near future, a machine that would
> be capable not only of recognising the contours of shapes, but also of completely interpreting the visual field, of staging a complex environment close-up or at a distance? Aren't they also talking about the new technology of *visionics*: the possibility of achieving sightless vision whereby the video camera would be controlled by a computer? The computer would be responsible for the machine's - rather than the televiewer's - capacity to analyse the ambient environment and automatically interpret the meaning of events. Such technology would be used in industrial production and stock control; in military robotics, too, perhaps.[^15_Treske_Ch12_29]
