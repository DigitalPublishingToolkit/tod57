An ancient bell rings: πάντα ῥεῖ—all flows. This is how the pre-Socratic
philosopher Heraclitus described the essence of the universe. Later,
Plato would rephrase this and say that a man can never enter the same
river twice. What holds for the river must also be true for man: humans
change; they do not stay the same over time. Every perception, every
experience, changes how we think. Experiences themselves also change.

## Substance - Substantial Motion 

We see video as an emanation, a surplus that adds to the world
(emanation, from the Latin emanare meaning *to flow from*). Still, we
live in Video Worlds or *Umwelten*, which define how we perceive and
interact with it. We understand the world by simply following
sensations; watching or viewing entails following stimuli in various
frequencies or instants. Philosophically, the substance of Video is not
the image at all, not a picture, or a cinematographic definition.

Azadeh Emadi explores the essence of digital video through the lens of
Mulla Sadra's philosophy, emphasizing an "inside-out" perspective.[^09_Treske_Ch6_1]
She argues that while Gilles Deleuze acknowledges the image's composed
nature (molar), he also recognizes the underlying *becoming* at the
pixel level (molecular). Similarly, Sadra's view posits stability and
form as arising from motion, aligning with Deleuze's concept of
becoming.

Unlike analog film, with its static frames creating the illusion of
movement, digital video presents a single, constantly evolving image.
These internal changes, driven by pixels, reflect a relationship with
the external world. The code is informed by the filmed object, causing
movement and changes within related digital elements. Pixels, like us,
possess an inherent *destination* that encapsulates the universe's
destinations. As microcosms, they contain the *seminal reasons* of the
larger world, and their *substantial renewal* mirrors the renewal of all
existence.

This concept of *Substantial Motion* suggests that digital video, with
its unified yet ever-changing pixels, has the potential to more
truthfully represent reality. It exists in infinite time, forming a
moving image unit while its internal elements constantly transform.

In contrast, the identifiable frame of analog film creates a sense of
representation, separating us from the image itself. It becomes a window
to observe, not a portal to explore. This *looking at* approach closes
interpretive possibilities. Emadi proposes *looking into* the image,
experiencing it, and discovering its potential connections to other
entities, beings, and images. From this perspective, digital video
challenges our perception of a stable, identified image. Our own
perception creates the division between entities in the world, including
the distinction between an image as representation and the object it
represents.

## From Motion to Movement

Birds never fly backwards. Aristotle viewing the world and reflecting on
its choreographies, describes an exponent when he concludes that *In
nature nothing has a movement backwards*. Aristotle’s *law of movement*
has *its actuality in the consequent*, and applies *alike in figures and
things animate*, constituting a series, *each successive term of which
potentially contains its predecessor*.[^09_Treske_Ch6_2] Movements are world making.

We are moving. Objects in a frame are moving. Through montage and
editing in film, movement takes place between framed images. The
recording, streaming camera is moving. Lenses are moving, zooming in and
out. The signal is moving. Data is changing. Everything moves.

Cognitive neuroscience sees human experience as a form of relational
experience:

>We live in relation with other people, objects, landscapes that are
present in our real world, but also live in relation with people,
objects, landscapes that come to us within the imaginary worlds
displayed by the arts.[^09_Treske_Ch6_3]

Does each form of movement imply a particular form of a relation between
us, others, objects, screen, screen objects and so on?

An illustrated letter, a single folded page sent by Jean Tinguely to a
16 year old, rubbed superhero’s, unfortunately lost colorful small
feathers, found objects, and a confirmation of obsession with movement.

Fascinated by his sculptures, I had written to Museum Ludwig in Cologne
to forward a letter to Jean Tinguely and received a surprisingly
personal answer. Movement, since Tinguely’s response has followed me as
a central element in my career as a filmmaker, editor and producer, as
an artist and writer, but also, and mainly, in my continuing reflections
on video, cinema and the post-digital. Tinguely’s kinetic art not only
just represented movement: crazy, silly, and ironic. His sculptures
embodied fundamental ontological and social processes, emphasizing
dynamism, change, and the breaking down of static forms. An interesting
parallel seems to be appearing in the world of online video and social
media platforms. Short, looping videos capture our attention through
constant motion, a digital obsession. TikTok in particular has become
known for its fast-paced, constantly moving content. Users scroll
never-ending streams. An aesthetic of instability, a constructive
instability, dominates our platform culture. Obviously, maybe even in
different realms, this digital kinetic obsession might echo Tinguely’s
mechanical curiosities. The worlds of his kinetic sculptures and those
of online videos would seem to be miles apart, but the embedded
principle is a fasciation with movement and its ability to captivate,
surprise and convey meaning, ephemerally, pointlessly, but
fundamentally: a continuum of artistic and cultural exploration of
motion.

## Curiosity

Cinema, and I always come back to this at once relative and solid
definition of the *visual (moving images)*, is an in-depth study of
movement. Video is its fluid state, component, or appearance, just as
ice is a specific state of water (though here, a solid state). The
history of cinema is, at the start, critically tied to the study of
movement. The invention of all the tools that led to the making of
cinema aimed, it seems, simply at the analysis of the body. Wasn’t it
one of the first curious questions answered by a camera recording: a gun
shooting a sequences of images confirming that the legs of a horse
sometimes don’t touch the ground? The cinematic apparatus realizing
itself now in video or the visual was designed as an investigation into
optics, bodies, motion, and physiology. Movement is the first motivation
for technological development.

> From 1895 until 1900, films of fact, or ‘actualities’, capture the
> imagination. Running up to five minutes, films of fact focused on
> everyday events such as New York in the Blizzard. Filmmakers began to
> record specific events, for example, The Kaiser Reviews His Troops and
> The Spanish Coronation. The novelty of movement yielded to a desire to
> edify, and the use of the camera for documentation was explicit in
> these early films (see Jaeds 1979: 2-3). Film became recognized as a
> tool capable of recording events that could be shown again and again
> to those who were unable to witness those events in person. All of
> these films were shot in a single take, that is, in one camera
> run.[^09_Treske_Ch6_4]

The cinematic apparatus not only captures the movement of objects before
it; it also includes two essential kinds of movement in itself: it moves and the recording medium moves, transporting fixed images in time. The recorded movement is an illusion created by the recording and transporting of still images, which are nothing else than frozen photographs of motion, instants in sequence. The discovery of the moving motion picture camera sets in motion the aesthetic and ethic of
cinema and the cinematic apparatus. The moving picture camera allows one to take control of the viewer’s perspective. The movement of the camera introduces a new powerful relation between the subject and the camera. Movement by itself creates significance. The camera moves and changes the perspective of the viewer, and the camera frames and shows us only a part of an object/subject. There is something outside the frame, what the camera doesn’t show, and there is something inside, which is related to it. The outside and the inside create a dramatic attraction. Object movement and camera movement create a rhythm, a fluent and magic
atmosphere. All together it’s the cinematic combination of time and space. Its part of the language, the syntax of film.[^09_Treske_Ch6_5]

The moving camera adds *kinaesthetic*, bodily, tactile cues as well as
the sense of balance and gravity. The visual appears live. The camera
motion is bodily, the experience mobile. There is the affect of an
intentionality and subjectivity, and a bodily appearance. While
obviously being in the real world a viewer might subjectively locate
herself aesthetically in a film or movie, and relate to the cinematic
visual.[^09_Treske_Ch6_6] We are there. We are given the missing information for
shape, size and layout, and depth of space. The camera itself might
become like another person. It is connecting me, making me involved,
taking me by the hand. The fluidity of movement gives me a sense of
immersion. And when it shakes, it is, of course, my over-excitement.

*Cinematography is a writing with images in movement* … Robert Bresson
defines cinematography as the act of filmmaking.[^09_Treske_Ch6_7] The Russian
filmmaker Dziga Vertov idealized the camera to the extreme. He called
the moving camera, in combination with editing, the *kino-eye*. The
camera is superior to the human eye, able to see at long distances, to
film in slow or fast motion, taking extreme perspectives, going where we
can’t. In the editing process, scenes from different times and places
could be cut together and united. The *kino-eye* was liberated from the
confines of time and space. A *kino-eye film* was able, Vertov believed,
to reveal a deeper level of truth in the world than was normally
perceived by the all too imperfect human eye.[^09_Treske_Ch6_8]

> world unknown to you.[^09_Treske_Ch6_9]

Camera movement has, within the means of cinematic design, an
extraordinary position: when and how the camera moves might have a lot
to do with this position, and from what perspective and with what kind
of aesthetic the viewer shall experience the film is central to design
and expression.

Is the world passing by or are we in the middle of everything? Does the
audience experience the scenes as a quiet, slow river or a high-dynamic,
wild ride? A basic assumption of cinematography is that the camera
determines a way of seeing things.[^09_Treske_Ch6_10]

## a phone in a cage

Digital filmmaking allows for extreme long takes or plan sequence, while
at the same time generating an ocean of ultra-short videos. Cage’s frame
might include a simple long movement of either an object inside, outside
or with, or a multitude of movement, changing signals throughout time
and space.

Movement might be a matter of walking or stabilization, hand held or
technically supported, attached to a cage, gimbal or drone, extended
image making with mechanical and optical extensions or generated and
enhanced signals.

What is the difference between an amateur and a professional camera? The
answer is very visible: the amount of manual control and the supporting
tools. Actually, the professional camera doesn’t hide its lens; it’s
visible and controllable to give the most possible effect on the image.

## Who else dreams of flying? 

The opening of Shining. Aerial Shots. *Dies Irae*, the music
accompanying. Many movies establish location in their first moments of
screening through aerial imagery. Across film history, this practice
claims that *you are here, in the space of the movie*.

Aerial views of landscapes, people and objects moving and following from
above had long been out of the reach for the general public. We move our
bodies about on the ground, on feet, on wheels, motorized, on water in
boats, in the air by plane. But, we need to rent a plane or a
helicopter, or, as in Cappadocia, book a touristic hot air ballon tour
for a day to see from above. Sight-seeing adventure.

The earliest forms of aerial imagery predominantly centered on urban
landscapes, whether through *bird's eye* perspectives or the pioneering
aerial photographs taken by Felix Nadar and his son in the mid-1800s, as
they captured Paris and its surroundings from their balloon. With World
War I and finally World War II, aerial photography brought to the
foreground the broadest scale of devastation. The imagery of destroyed
cities, bombed from the air, dominates the archives of aerial
photography.

Even as everything seen by the cameras on planes was being documented
and as photographs from the air were analyzed and archived, looking and
seeing did not necessarily entail the discovery of objects on the
ground. Despite photographing Auschwitz from the air already early in
World War II, the Allies were not aware of the concentration camp. They
simply were not looking for it, as Harun Farocki showed in detail in his
documentary.[^09_Treske_Ch6_11] The aerial images are flat.

In a form of movement and aerial photography combined, a boom in the
availability and use of drones has led to the ability to easily produce
videos from above. Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), include a
diverse range of remotely controlled or autonomous flying devices. These
can take the form of fixed-wing aircraft, resembling small airplanes, or
multi-rotor systems similar to helicopters. Modern drones can be
operated by mobile applications, wearable devices, or specific dedicated
ground control stations. Drones typically include cameras and sensors,
enabling them to capture and transmit or record visual data in
real-time. For military and public safety purposes, drones serve crucial
roles in surveillance and emergency response. They are used for
agricultural tasks, mapping, and disaster management, as well as, of
course, news coverage. Event organizers employ drones to monitor crowds
and provide live streaming capabilities. Real estate agents leverage
them for house sales. The television and film industry embraces drone
technology to capture dramatic aerial footage. For tourism, the use of
drones to produce videos has generated a large amount of visually
appealing footage of various destinations, attracting much attention on
social media.

The COVID-19 pandemic transformed urban landscapes into strange empty
spaces, captured through contrasting technological perspectives. Drone
footage documented deserted metropolitan areas, showing sterile streets
and vacant public spaces from above. These aerial views presented cities
in an almost surreal state, simultaneously familiar yet altered,
creating a visual record of an unprecedented moment in urban history.

These drone perspectives stood in sharp contrast to the intimate,
close-up views of life during lockdown captured through video
conferencing platforms like Zoom. The pandemic created a visual
dichotomy: the vast, empty spaces seen from above versus the confined,
personal spaces viewed through screens. Within these aerial views,
occasional signs of life—whether human activity, wildlife, or
vegetation—served as reminders of the persistent vitality beneath the
apparent desolation, creating a complex interplay between the built
environment and natural elements that continued to thrive. If drone
footage documented a sense of loss and disconnection, narratives
emphasized emptiness. A video from New Delhi titled *Incredible India:
Before and After Lockdown* suggests a transition from a past of contact
to a future of absence. What this footages does not capture is the
underlying health crisis: the virus itself remained invisible, creating
a disconnect between visual documentation and actual threat.

## Time suspended

In 2014, British filmmaker Danny Cooke released a compelling short film
that resonated deeply with viewers. The three-minute video, published on
Vimeo, combines striking visuals with an atmospheric musical score. The
somber footage, partially captured using drone technology, provides a
haunting perspective of Chernobyl's abandoned cityscape. Cooke shares
his personal connection to the project, noting that the 1986 nuclear
disaster occurred in the year of his birth and impacted his own family
during their time in Italy. He describes Chernobyl as one of the most
fascinating yet hazardous locations he has encountered in his work.[^09_Treske_Ch6_13]
The filmmaker reflects on the distinctive atmosphere of the abandoned
city, observing that it possessed both a serene and deeply unsettling
quality. He describes the location as a place where time appears
suspended, surrounded by echoes of the past.

The emergence and impact of drones represents a significant
technological development of the 2010s, particularly in how they reshape
social and political relationships through remote observation. Aerial
drones have gained the most attention through their military
applications. Drones serve as tools of global surveillance and power
projection. Space collapses through networked digital technology. As
they become consumer products, available through retail channels,
ethical and privacy concerns rise, with surveillance risks overshadowed
by their entertainment value. The transformation of military technology
normalizes surveillance, as well as remote engagement and the nature of
technological mediation.[^09_Treske_Ch6_14]

## Blue Sky Days, unblemished by a single cloud

> I no longer love blue skies. In fact, I now prefer gray skies. The
> drones do not fly when the skies are grey.

> —Zubair Rehman

This striking observation is from Zubair Rehman’s 2013 congressional
testimony on U.S. drone campaigns. The photographer van Houtryve later
incorporated Rehman’s observation into his series title *Blue Sky Days*.
Rehman's testimony provided a profound perspective on how drone
operations affect civilian populations in conflict zones. His
grandmother had been killed by a drone strike in Pakistan's border
region in 2012, an incident that also left him wounded by shrapnel. This
poignant statement reveals more or less how drone warfare has
fundamentally altered even the most basic human experiences,
transforming a blue sky into a source of anxiety and fear.[^09_Treske_Ch6_15]

Yes, weather plays a role in war. Carl Clausewitz knew this when he
pointed out that it is fog that clouds the enemy and yourself. *Fog
makes vision uncertain.*

> *Fog functions*…to give shape to the vague and unpredictable; it is
> evidently not as foggy as *uncertainty* itself, which it is supposed
> to make more tangible. This fog does not obscure so much as it
> provides a form, albeit a hazy, shifting one, for something more
> abstract that is not directly accessible to the senses…Fog straddles
> the literal-figurative divide, representing intangibles, clarifying
> other figurative terms, and sometimes standing in as *itself*, a
> meteorological phenomenon in the atmosphere.[^09_Treske_Ch6_16]

Invisibility is a refuge. So, why do we need or want images at all? Do
images give us real connections, relations, empathy and care for others?
Do they bridge the distance between me and their devastated situation,
their suffering? We look at people on the ground, people without faces.
Do they exist? Is this the basic condition of drone warfare?

> The ability to hide and deny a drone strike is not an insignificant
> side effect of this technology, but a central part of a campaign that
> relies to a great extent on secrecy and deniability. The violence
> inflicted by drone warfare is thus typically compounded by the
> perpetrators’ negation: the violence against people and things
> redoubled by violence against the evidence that violence has taken
> place.[^09_Treske_Ch6_17]

Drone vision is intimately uncanny. The extended capacity of perception makes the drone a paradigmatic figure in our networked world, generating anxious ambivalence.

If we think about how we've traditionally captured images of war, from battlefield paintings to war photography to combat footage, we realize,
as Paul Virilio pointed out, that military technology and visual technology have always developed hand in hand. Drones have changed this relationship.

Unlike a soldier looking through a rifle scope or a war photographer peering through a lens, drone vision creates something entirely new: a perspective that's fundamentally detached from human eyes. While traditional war imagery tried to capture what a person would see if they were there, drone footage shows us something we could never see by ourselves: a cold, distant, algorithmic view of the world below.

This is a new way of seeing which isn't just changing warfare, it's seeping into art, activism, and popular culture. There is something more strange and elusive about drone imagery. Unlike a photograph or video
that feels like a direct window onto reality, drone images feel more remote, more processed, more digital in their very nature. They're creating a new kind of visual evidence that we are still trying to understand.

This matters because we've long trusted what we can see with our own eyes, or at least through technologies that extend our natural vision.
Photos and videos have carried weight in courtrooms and shaped public opinion precisely because they seemed to show us *what really happened*.
But drone imagery is different; it shows us something no human eye could see, from perspectives no human could naturally achieve. This raises fascinating questions about how we should interpret and trust these new kinds of images that are increasingly shaping our understanding of events happening around the world.[^09_Treske_Ch6_18]

Drones symbolize our social media age, capturing images that reflect both the beauty and strangeness of the world while also serving as tools for surveillance and data collection.

Drones operate by analyzing human behaviors and patterns through continuous monitoring, allowing operators and algorithms to identify significant events and anomalies. This capability is crucial in military
contexts, where understanding daily activities can help anticipate potential threats. The goal of drone surveillance is to differentiate between normal and abnormal behaviors, thereby enabling preemptive
actions against perceived threats.

Drone surveillance contributes to a form of governance that determines who has the right to live or die based on data analysis. This leads to a visual economy that reflects operational chaos rather than divine order,
highlighting the role of drones in maintaining a state of exception in societal control.[^09_Treske_Ch6_19]

The drone is an experience of weightless dominance in its displacement and augmentation of the ‘metabolic vector’ for the ‘void’, not so much of speed, but of invulnerability.[^09_Treske_Ch6_20]

Fig. 6. CO-EXIST WITH YOUR COAX

Finally a variety of BNC adapters and other ancillary items are
available. One popular BNC adapter is the straight through adapter,
allowing two cables with male connectors fitted to be connected end to
end. Other "T" adapters are also available. These have a male plug at
the bottom of the “T" and two female connections at either end of the
horizontal of the "T". These are ideal for use with oscilloscopes where
a through connection needs to be measured, and the "T" BNC adapter
enables the required connections to be made.[^09_Treske_Ch6_22]

The sockets or female BNC connectors also come in a number of flavours.
The very basic BNC

connector consists of a panel mounting assembly with a single connection
for the coax centre. The earthing is then accomplished via the panel to
which the connector is bolted using a single nut. Large washers can be
used to provide an earth connection directly to the connector. Some of
these connectors may also use four nuts and bolts to fix them to the
panel. These arrangements are only suitable for low frequency
applications, and not for RF. Where impedance matching and full
screening is required. Most surveillance DVRs and CCTV cameras have BNC
female output.

There are two main variants of the BNC connector assembly method:

• Compression gland type

• Crimp type

The compression gland type has the centre pin of the connector which is
usually a solder pin and
the braid and sheath of the cable are held by an expanding compression
gland fixed by a nut at the rear of the connector. This type of
connector by its nature can cope with a (limited) range of cable sizes
and requires no specialised tooling to assemble. This makes it ideal for
small quantity production, either for one off cables for laboratory use
of for limited production runs.

The crimp connector has the centre pin which is normally crimped to the
centre conductor. This crimped pin is then pushed into position through an inner ferrule which
separates the inner insulation sheath and the braid of the cable. An outer ferrule is then
crimped over the braid and outer insulation which fixes the cable to the connector. Greater
accuracy is required for the crimp style connectors and therefore the correct connector variant must be
chosen for the cable being used. This may result in a crimp style connector not being practicable
for some cable types. In addition to this the assembly requires the use of the correct crimping
tools to ensure that the connector is correctly crimped. While these connectors are always
preferred for large production runs because they are much faster to assemble, it is not possible for
them to be reworked for obvious reasons.

For both styles of BNC connector it is essential that the exact amount
of insulation is stripped from each section to ensure accurate assembly
and the required RF performance.[^09_Treske_Ch6_23].
