**Video is a cybernetic medium**

Tom Sherman writes on Facebook in September 2015:

Early video art challenged the dominance of television, the king of
centralized media, by dissecting and critiquing it. Unlike traditional
cinema's focus on narrative storytelling, video emerged as a
decentralized tool for anyone to create, offering the potential for
anyone to be an author. These early video artists weren't interested in
simply carrying on the storytelling tradition of cinema. Their focus was
on using video as an electronic tool to understand the here and now, the
immediate events unfolding around them. They explored how this
electronic intervention impacted the world and its effects on society,
politics, economics, and even aesthetics. In simpler terms, video, with
its ability to document, receive feedback, and continuously adapt
representation, became a powerful tool for social change, pushing
boundaries in all these areas.

In his seminars on video at Middle East Technical University in the
mid-90s, the Turkish sociologist and media philosopher Ulus Baker
emphasized that video differs from cinema. It's not just about
technology. We appreciate cinema, but video offers new possibilities, he
underlined. We can create an archive of open-ended works with video
works, like unfinished music, that can connect to other videos. We don't
need a rigid structure to create an ending, as in a film, and the
challenge, says Baker, is how to achieve this. Our explanations and
conclusions might be lacking, but that's part of the exploration.
Godard, for instance, aimed for a *new image type*, a combination of all
visual elements. This *I see* approach in video goes beyond cinema. In
Godard's work, cinema is re-evaluated within a new visual style. He
appreciates cinema but also seeks to expand it. Baker connects to
Tarde's philosophy: new things come from encounters. The theater has
grappled with similar issues. Grotowski's *poor theater* stripped away
everything but the actor's body, in reaction to cinema's spectacle. In
theater, you're not a passive observer but part of the experience.
Cinema, however, presents a pre-existing world. The *I see* in cinema
puts interpretation in the viewer's hands. As a pure *I see,* video
offers the potential to explore these possibilities more freely.
Ultimately, we must invent new ways of *seeing* with video. Video for
Baker brings thinking back to the act of speech rather than writing.

We are citing ready items of thoughts through the replay of video and
sharing. But isn't it like any experience, in that it has been there,
and any thought has been formed, deja vu? The technique of instant
replay added to our human abilities. The storage of audiovisual sense or
sensation equal experience aims to hold the moment in flow and stop
forgetting instant access.

Endless resolution and endless looks, views, memory machine, assisting
brain or in creating intelligence through the ability of memory device.

Baker builds his ideas partially on the philosophy of Kant, bringing
back questioning the focus on simple observation (*I see*). This
reevaluation challenged the way artists viewed the world. Imagine a
path, says Baker, starting with Descartes (known for *I think. Therefore
I am*) and leading to modern philosophers like Blanchot and Foucault.
Descartes's statement marked the beginning of contemporary philosophy,
emphasizing the importance of reason and thought over mere perception.
However, Kant argued that thought isn't just abstract concepts. It's
about applying ideas within a specific time and space. He uses the
French Revolution as an example: its ideals would only have mattered
with the legal framework established afterward. Following Kant, modern
thought emphasizes the practical application of ideas. Today, any idea
or concept needs a real-world context to be considered valuable. Simply
having an idea without a way to put it into practice holds little
weight.

Images are seen as records of things within time and space, following
Kant's ideas. Baker argues that if our existence is proven by action (*I
walk, therefore I exist*), can the same be said for seeing? (*I see,
therefore I think*). Video as a medium can prove thought because it's
always trapped within the limitations of time and space.

Before Kant, we assumed thinking perfectly mirrored reality. We believed
ideas were pre-existing things we had to remember or invent. Kant
changed this. He argued there's a difference between the world itself
(the *thing in itself*) and how we experience it (the *appearance*). Our
minds actively shape our experience through concepts like space and
time. So, when we say *I see* or *I think*, it's not a guarantee we're
directly grasping the thing itself. We can only ever experience it
through the lens of our minds. This shift from passive reflection to
active construction became a key idea in modern philosophy. Just as an
image in a movie can spark an idea, our experiences can trigger
thoughts. This is similar to how editing techniques in film (like those
used by Eisenstein) can guide the viewer's experience. Baker suggests
that video art should indirectly imitate this process to create a
*thinking instrument* for viewers, avoiding the manipulative techniques
of modern advertising.

What are the conditions of being determined?

> I can guess that: *her yiğidin bir yoğurt yeyişi vardır* deriz de *her
> yoğurdun bir yiğide farklı bir yeniş biçimi vardır" demeyiz…*[^20_Treske_Ch16_4]

Suppose we see cinema and video always as an activity of reactions.
While cinema often focuses on responses, Baker proposes two essential
purposes for cinema: depicting daily life and creating fantastical
worlds. The second has become more popular, but the first offers a more
critical perspective for him. Subjectivity is not simply a given.
Subjectivity requires actively constructing viewpoints and attitudes,
which can be challenging and constantly in flux. Authentic subjectivity
isn't fixed or inherited but a continuous process of creation and
potential failure.

In his attempt to understand video, Baker draws on Kant’s schemas, which
aren’t pictures but rather the underlying rules that govern how
something is perceived. A schema is a concept that bridges the gap
between our abstract ideas and the world we perceive through our senses.
Kant believed we have pure concepts, like causality or substance, that
aren't learned from experience. Schemata are not mental images. They are
more like processes or guidelines for making sense of our sensations
according to our concepts.

The focus on *seeing* in video creates a unique space for thinking
linked to the act of observation. Baker is questioning why video, with
its focus on the act of seeing, isn't considered a more valuable tool
for creative expression in a society dominated by spectacle (like dream
cinema) and low-quality television (*poor TV*).

In a break from traditional filmmaking, Godard embraced revolution and
documentary styles (*Cinéma-Vérité*). He used video to create films, but
in a way that defied expectations. Unlike classic cinema's *I show you*
approach, Godard's films embodied an *I see* perspective. Cinematic
conventions do not limit this new way of seeing the world. Evaluating
everything through traditional cinema doesn't work with video. While
initially seen as avant-garde, video presents new challenges: its place
as a mass medium and its artistic potential.

Cinema has yet to achieve its full potential. Deleuze and Godard
believed films could make audiences think critically, but cinema is
still mostly seen as entertainment. He emphasizes the importance of
truly *seeing* a movie, not just watching it passively. Great directors
have shown a *high-seeing* ability beyond what can be described. This
contrasts with *low talking*, everyday speech that just relays what can
be seen. True art uses language (*high talking*) to express things that
can't be seen. Blanchot, unlike others, believed in the possibility of
*high seeing* in film. Watching a movie isn't enough; you must grasp its
deeper meaning. A film becomes truly powerful when it transcends
language and can't be fully explained with words.

**The GAP**

In his doctoral thesis, Ulus Baker explored a gap in social science:

> For seven years, I wrestled with how to integrate film analysis into
> the study of social issues. While documentaries are often viewed as
> mere illustration, I believe they offer a powerful way to capture the
> essence of human experience. I see myself as a social scientist who
> utilizes film, not as a documentarian or video artist. Unlike
> traditional researchers, I believe video archives can be more than
> just data. A camera's perspective can reveal hidden aspects of a
> situation, like poverty, in a way text cannot. Documentary filmmakers
> have a unique ethical responsibility. They understand the impact of
> their choices, unlike many social scientists who rely solely on
> surveys. Our research often lacks a deep understanding of the lived
> experience. We can analyze, discuss, and propose solutions, but we may
> never truly *see* the issue. My inspiration came from studying still
> lifes (Naturmorts). Initially, these paintings depicted wealthy
> households. Poverty was only hinted at through symbols of death and
> decay. However, by the 19th century, artists like Cezanne used still
> lifes to portray the destruction of working-class communities.
>
> I believe poverty can be portrayed in positive ways, not just through
> symbols of lack. A crack in a wall, a pregnant woman, a hand churning
> butter—all these elements can tell a story. My thesis argued that film
> has the potential to create a powerful archive of poverty unlike
> traditional social science methods. This archive wouldn't rely on
> pre-existing footage. I wouldn't just record poverty or sift through
> existing visuals. Instead, I would explore the full spectrum of
> possibilities for representing poverty on film. Ultimately, I reject
> the rigid separation of art and science. Every artwork embodies
> thought and reflection. Likewise, research without emotional
> connection seems pointless to me.[^20_Treske_Ch16_5]

Ulus Baker's main interest was a call to a politics of affect, to
inspire people and challenge dominant power structures and ideologies.
He draws on Spinoza's notion of *affections* to understand social life:
a dynamic, non-linguistic form of a relation between entities with the
definition of images as *affective thought processes*. Sociology is too
focused on summarizing opinions, which are unreliable and better suited
for journalism or traditional archives. He proposes a *sociology of
affects* that studies emotions and experiences. He believes film and
video are powerful tools for analyzing society, capturing the
*invisible* aspects that text-based approaches miss. He sees traditional
methods in sociology, which rely on analyzing written works, as limited
and prone to bias. Baker suggests a new approach that incorporates
visual and audio elements alongside text, inspired by the montage
technique of filmmaking. This could revolutionize how sociology is
taught and practiced. He highlights the rise of the *image age* with the
growth of video and electronic media. These *thought-images* he sees as
a new way of conveying knowledge and understanding, potentially
replacing traditional text-based information. In simpler terms, Baker
argues that sociology should move beyond just studying opinions and
focus on emotions and experiences.

Images hold a hidden power. Godard notes that it is not possible to see
*the same smile in the faces of Soviet worker girls and the German
youth* (Nazi propaganda). This *power of the image* could be used to
explore emotions and social connections through documentaries. The
challenge is in combining documentary filmmaking with social science.
Social science offers theories and methods, while documentaries have
powerful images but lack a solid theoretical framework. The goal is to
create a *sociology of affects* that uses documentary images to explore
societal emotions. Film, from its beginnings, has analyzed social
realities. Baker argues that cinema isn't just for analysis by other
disciplines; it can analyze things itself. The danger isn't the power of
images but their misuse. Television, for example, turns images into
repetitive clichés. The key is to liberate images from becoming mere TV
clichés.

Our archive is multimedia, going beyond mere opinions. It captures
sights, sounds, and emotions. Similar to Michel Foucault's *énoncé*
(statements), these elements are uncommon, and their scarcity defines
their existence. Clichés and opinions are ubiquitous, forming a constant
background noise. But as Castoriadis observed, people often dismiss them
as meaningless or tune them out—a phenomenon he called the *rise of
non-importance*. Only by critically analyzing television and even using
its methods can we cultivate a *neo-Vertovian* sensibility. Images can
be creative forces that produce new ways of seeing the world.

Emotions like desire, joy, and sadness are linked to our will to
exist.[^20_Treske_Ch16_6] They show how strong we are in this pursuit. Negri builds on
this, saying emotions are a force for personal and collective action.
They're personal. They connect us to the unmeasurable aspects of life
and the collective because they connect us to each other.

We're all connected (as minds, bodies, and feeling beings) and actively
shape the world around us, a world of struggle, power, and desire. Just
by having desires, we're part of this world-building process.

Affects are emotions and feelings, but not simply reactions to events.
They are seen as forces that can shape our understanding of the world.
Baker’s *sociology of affects* focuses on these forces rather than on
fixed opinions. This focus on affects has several implications for
political thought. First, it expands the range of actors and forms of
resistance. People don't need fully formed opinions to challenge the
status quo. Second, it emphasizes the role of the body and emotions in
political life. Thinking isn't a purely rational process but is shaped
by our feelings.
