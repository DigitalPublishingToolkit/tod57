LOG:: 07 Objects Of Interest

> Now objects perceive me.
>
> Paul Klee

Paul Virillio relays this line from the painter Paul Klee. What Klee
imagined has become the truth. We humans are no longer the subject who
sees.[^12_Treske_Ch8_1] Virillio’s *Vision Machine* was, at the time of its writing,
somehow still speculative: a fiction of a machine that not only
recognizes shapes and contours but can also interpret a complex visual
environment, directly operated by a computer, automatically interpreting
the meaning of change and events in the observed field.[^12_Treske_Ch8_2]

Seeing has become a matter or ability of a material. Computer or machine
vision is a massive research field in the sciences. Still, we need to
understand non-human seeing technology's cultural aspects and impact. We
realize that a shift is happening, and this shift relates to human
perception. We are still determining if the change will be an expansion
of our perception, a controlling force, and a power of capital to
co-construct how we live and act in our world.

Photography is a simple example of the technological shift of a medium's
meaning and use. Photography has seen two essential value shifts. The
first is a value shift from the individual aesthetic of the artist as a
photographer to the collaborative and social aesthetics of social media
platform services or applications. The second value shift is using
photographic images as a vast, combined data fabric to extract
information, train chatbots, and re-deliver this cumulative information
as a totally different package.[^12_Treske_Ch8_3]

Our lives are saturated with photos. Our smartphones capture everything,
from selfies to everyday scenes. Visuals dominate communication, and
images are attached to almost every message. This constant capturing and
sharing turns us into both consumers and creators of imagery.

The sheer volume of photos has become overwhelming. The rise of selfies
exemplifies this. Manually sorting and organizing is no longer feasible.
We are unable to extract information in the way Daguerre was, where the
camera and the photograph—as well as the photographer—documented and
witnessed a single fact. We need AI to step in. Machines excel at
analyzing vast amounts of photos, identifying patterns, and highlighting
key moments. AI is then not just a sorting tool, it's starting to shape
our visual language. It learns our photography preferences and even
suggests new styles. This automation is driven by powerful computing,
vast datasets, and sophisticated algorithms. Individual desktop
computers will likely become relics, replaced by cloud-based,
mobile-centric technology generating a general aesthetic.

*Images* and *objects* are looking back at us. Instead of passively
consuming visuals, we already interact with them in a dynamic way.
Photos don’t just document our life; they actively influence it, perhaps
even subconsciously. But, what kind of *images* or *objects* are looking
at us? What is happening or has changed in our relation to *things*?

**Cinematographic Objects**

For years, different fields have debated the role of objects. However,
film and media studies haven't fully explored how such work might
contribute to understanding agency, both human and non-human. What if we
saw cinema not just as a way to show things, but as a machine for
learning about them? In this light, what can cinema tell us about
objects and their relationship with humans and non-humans?

Films are full of objects, on different levels. There are the things we
see on screen, the objects the film is about, and even the film itself
as an object. Martin Heidegger might call these *Zeug*, or useful
things.

Volker Pantenburg's book *Cinematographic Objects* delves into how film
theory defines and categorizes objects. Different theorists have
different ideas. Balazs is drawn to the surface qualities of objects,
while Epstein focuses on their active power. Casetti argues that
Epstein's work suggests objects can even *act* on viewers. Thomas
Elsaesser analyzes the specific example of the carousel on screen. He
proposes a new way to think about film, moving beyond the idea of the
image simply capturing reality. Instead, he suggests *energy* is a
better concept, as it applies to different film technologies and
captures the various types of energy involved, from mechanical to
digital.[^12_Treske_Ch8_4]

Energy today is experienced as distributive, networked, nodal. As such,
it is closer to information and code. Energy in cinema is the ability to
convert mechanically generated movement into brain perception and body
sensation (Deleuze and Kittler). The object carousel as a para-, proto-,
and meta-cinematic object par excellence, points, in Elsaesser's
reflection, to an idea of cinema that *finally can, and perhaps should,
only exist in mind.*[^12_Treske_Ch8_5]

Of course, this reflection on the cinematographic object is grounded in
a form of cinema that is already inadequate, despite directors like
Christopher Nolan and Hollywood capital proofs a nostalgia for
celluloid. Cinematographic objects, in this form of reflection, or
*Betrachtung*, as a theoretical approach, don't offer more to our
understanding of what is happening in the further algorithmic automation
of culture. Cinema in 2024 is a niche, a system inside a broader
cultural system offering a specific form of formalized entertainment,
while streaming and platforms dominate the daily.

**thing and medium**

A very different reflection on objects comes from a 1926 essay by Fritz
Heider, “Ding und Medium*”*. Thanks to Niklas Luhmann and Dirk Baecker,
this essay is available today.

Heider, a psychologist by training, was partial to Gestalt psychology,
with which he eventually made a career in the US. In 1920, Heider
received his doctorate with a thesis on causality under Alexius Meinong,
a student of Franz Bretano who became known for his object theory. Later
in the 1920s, in Munich, Heider worked with the psychologist Max
Wertheimer, one of the founders of Gestalt psychology. From 1927 on, he
worked with the psychologist William Stern, father of Günther Anders, in
Hamburg and emigrated to the US in 1930. In “Ding und Medium”, Heider
asks why our perception singles out an object. Causality would treat
everything as equally probable, so everything could be described through
cause and effect. However, observation makes clear that humans are not
determined, fixed creatures constrained by cause and effect. We can
create our forms of life through surprising new combinations of cause
and effect.[^12_Treske_Ch8_6]

Heider uses the example of a pencil and a lamp.

> I can see this pencil here, for example. It is illuminated by the
> lamp. The pencil therefore causes the process on the retina. We can
> also go back even further to the lamp; one could also say that the
> light from the lamp causes the retinal process. Why do I see the
> pencil and not something here just in front of my eye or the lamp?[^12_Treske_Ch8_7]

Heider attempts to ask about the causal processes that create an
energetic connection between a thing and our perception without us
noticing anything about the energy source, about the energy transfer
process between the thing and our senses, much less about the
calculation of this perception in our body and brain. We perceive
without perceiving the perception to which we owe a perception.

Heider suggests treating objects and media as similar in their basic
building blocks. These elements can be combined tightly or loosely.
Letters, for instance, are loosely connected, while words are a tight
combination of letters. This means letters act as the media that creates
a word object. Words can be loosely connected to form sentences, and
sentences can be combined to form texts.

This concept, later developed extensively by Niklas Luhmann, helps
Heider escape a cause-and-effect trap. He argues that perception isn't
caused by objects themselves but by the perceiver. Through our actions,
we select and solidify specific things from the vast possibilities the
media offers, essentially crystallizing them from the background. Heider
even lays the groundwork here for a new understanding of how actions
work.

The organism itself is a thing in the world. The object of cognition
does not act directly on the sense organ but through some mediation. He
asks whether a structure of the external world is decisive for
cognition, and, if so, what is this like. The world might be seen as a
network of causal processes. In terms of causation, all links in the
chain of cause and effect are equal, but not in terms of perception.
There is a unique link, namely our object of perception. Wave-mediated
remote perception—for we will restrict ourselves to this for the time
being (Heider)—structures the world into what is perceived, the objects
of perception, and the mediation through which perception occurs. Most
of the time, the objects of perception are the solid and semi-solid
things in our environment, and mediation is the air-filled space, the
medium that surrounds things. There are exceptions; for example, things
like glass serve as mediators; we can see through glass. But we will
ignore these exceptions for now and ask ourselves based on which
properties the things and media play the roles of the object of
knowledge and mediator. The medium and the stone are the substrates of
the event; they remain in place, and the energy moves through and over
these substrates and takes on different forms.

For Heider, the concept of energy is similar to the idea of information.
Energy excites things in the medium of their perception.

Heider continues by identifying two types of events: internally
conditioned events assigned to the substrate, and externally conditioned
events assigned to the influence. The medium event is externally
conditioned. What happens in the media depends on the form of the
incoming energy; the specific nature of the medium is largely irrelevant
to the form of the event. It is now necessary to distinguish between
unified and multiple events. An exact depiction, imposition, or
impression of a design is generally only possible if the thing is
imposed by or through events or that onto which something is imposed
consists of many independent parts. These imposed events form false
units, possibly because they can be traced back to uniform causes. If
the causes of the individual, independent shocks also had nothing to do
with each other, then it would be extremely unlikely that order and
regularity would arise.

Isn't everything in this world equally meaningful, grounded, and only
referring to itself? How can there be something that points to something
else? To point to something else, the sign must be closely associated
with this other, with the thing being signified. The sign must point to
something specific; it must not stand alone in the world; it must be
linked to something else and clearly to something specific. We find
these properties of association in the medium processes. All these
medium processes that affect our sense organs and give us information
about things are false units. These false units have the property of
pointing to something else; they are incomprehensible if they are not
related to the unified cause.

The diversity of signs could also have come about in another way. There
could be a single sign for every word, for every concept: a sign that
forms a unity in itself that is not composed of different independent
parts. Image language is such a sign system. Most sign systems, however,
use combinations to achieve multiplicity. Combining independent elements
also prevails in flag signals or Morse code. The arrangement of units
occurs not in space, as with letters, but in time. The arrangement of
points must come entirely from the person who gives the signs; it must
not arise in any way from the nature of the signs themselves. In other
words, the signs must be independent of one another. If the combination
is used in time, then the time position of one element must be
independent of the time positions of the other elements.

We must ask ourselves how the environment is structured in relation to
its vital importance and its immediate importance for the organism. Of
the countless possible environmental factors, we only need to know a few
to be fully oriented to them as concerns their potential relationships
to our bodies. We only live in a particular sphere of this world; we
have no relationship at all to much of what is around us and what is
happening; it is not really for us. The unity of the chair is,
therefore, objective. The chair has properties as a whole. Specific laws
and relationships between these whole properties are, to a high degree,
invariant compared to the determinations of the small particles. Being
spherical is one such property. It can be realized in an infinite number
of particle combinations. Each of these combinations has the further
property of being rollable. A solid ball can be rolled, no matter what
material it is made of. There is, therefore, a correlation between
different whole properties across the small particles and their
properties. For the sensory-physiological processes, these physical
systems are of great importance; for the practical structure of the
world that surrounds us and for the conditions of perception outside the
organism, structures of the type of solid units are probably more
important.

In our world, there are more gruesome and smaller units and parts of
larger wholes. The organism now steps between these things and creates
its world. The things become rich in relationships, almost all of which
are not transparently geometric. One must be clear: not everything has
meaning for us, and a great deal happens that does not even enter our
world. And the media are indeed filled with units that are of a lower
order, yet that are empty about our order. Both events, the coarse
material and that of the small molecules, are therefore linked to static
units. Only the coarse material is of importance to us. This connection
between most things carrying out their vibrations and media carrying out
imposed vibrations and the wave process is thus linked to the world in
which we live through associations, which is of great importance. This
becomes clear to us from the exceptions. There are opaque media and
opaque things. Fog has no coarse material significance for us; one can
move in it as if in *empty air*, but in it, the associations of light
waves with things are disturbed. Another exception is glass. It cannot
impose characteristic arrangements on the wave process; it lets the
orders through and transmits them like a medium. But it is a coarse
material unit; glass is a solid body. These exceptions have biological
significance. Sailors and mountain climbers die in fog, and small birds
perish if they have not adapted to these exceptions and hit window panes
with their beaks.

**Multiplicity events**

In cinema, the wall is the medium. Display devices are not ordinary
media that pass on the influence they receive. They have their own laws.
Display devices make something different from what hits them,
transposing this into changes that we can perceive with greater sensory
precision. Because of these laws, a display device is no longer a
perfect medium. It abstracts certain moments from the influence and
transposes their changes. This transposition must, of course, take place
according to stringent laws. That is, the changes in the pointer must be
precisely assigned to the changes in the influence. This is a medium
mediation law: the successive positions of the pointer are not linked by
a law specific to the pointer but are determined by external factors.
Suppose one creates it by excluding the influence of form (flat surface)
and lighting (uniform lighting) through suitable changes to the surface.
In that case, an image is created in the narrower sense of the word. A
projection image is created if one excludes the influence of form and
surface quality (a uniform white wall) through specific lighting. This
trace must be such that it sends out extensions similar to the ones that
form the trace. The extensions have thus been fixed, for this trace
substrate becomes a solid body whose parts cannot be moved relative to
one another, which asserts itself as a unity in the changes. It is a
fixation of false units, a fixation of mediation. In cinematographic
depiction, too, the sequence is broken down into a sequence following
one another, and an event is preserved in a solid body.

Because something like perception apparatuses exists in the world
structure, things generally have much more characteristic effects. They
become real in a much more comprehensive sense, since new possibilities
of effect are opened. How does a knife work, for example, in the usual
super-elementary connections? It works as a whole, as a physical unit;
it works through its weight and even its shape; the wedge shape of its
blade means it can cut. But when does its shape as a whole ever have a
uniform, characteristic effect on other bodies? One is tempted to say
this only happens in the organism, which recognizes its shape.

This reconstruction of the core units from the offshoots is now the
*synthesis of ideas and sensations*, the *production of the form*. The
necessity of such a synthesis is thus entirely understandable with
reference back to the structure of the external world. Every being
wishing to perceive its environment through a medium would have to use
such a synthesis. If we tried to construct an apparatus that reacts to
external things through a medium in a meaningful way, we would also have
to build this apparatus in such a way that it brings the multiplicity of
effects emanating from the units back together into units. In this
sense, the synthesis is conditioned by the external world. We will
assume that its more specific laws cannot be derived entirely from the
psyche.

The order that lies latent in the medium is made physically effective,
and this is also the first step in the meaningful unification of the
effects rushing through the medium. The lens is even more effective, in
that it keeps out what comes from other units and collects the
multiplicity from a unit. This is already the beginning of synthesis.
But only the beginning. The lens does indeed restore the order of the
light-emitting points. Still, how the points are grouped into units
needs to be assigned. On the screen or in front of the retina, the
points next to each other are of equal value and atomistic.

**General and special devices**

If the medium were not homogeneous and the rays did not spread out
according to a general pattern, a device for unification as generally
usable as the lens would be impossible. Constructing a device that
reunites the rays emanating from a point is possible. This duality is of
the utmost importance. Firstly, there is the event itself, but also its
meaning. The rays *signify* the points from which they come in some way.
And when they are reunited, they are reunited correctly and
meaningfully. This is analogous to the relationship between the physical
and the psychic. The physical is the carrier of the psychic. Two layers
of functional connections are superimposed on one another. The offshoots
must be reunited meaningfully into units, so the laws determine the type
of unification according to which the offshoots are assigned to the big
things. But of course, the physiological process of this unification
also has laws that are different from what it means.

There is a second possibility of the connection between the two layers.
The laws of the carriers of these events could correspond in their
structure to the laws of the layer of meaning. An apparatus could react
meaningfully to many different influences by virtue of the laws within
it. A change in the multiplicity of offshoots, i.e., in the stimulus,
would not result in something different in the central part, and this is
not because a changed stimulus sets in motion another apparatus
precisely tailored to it, but because the apparatus reacts differently.
The laws of the connection between offshoots and core events require
specific assignments for the return.

A single, adaptable apparatus connects everything; it reacts differently
depending on the cause. And, yes, we can improve our ability to perceive
things with things we make in workshops, with glasses, microscopes, and
telescopes.

The more specific the assignment of offshoot combinations to the center,
the less likely it is that there are physiological apparatuses that
respond meaningfully to many stimuli. The type of mediation influences
the image of the objects; we can even place mediation at the center of
perception. The hand is the perfect direct mediation of action, and we
can recognize its mediating properties. Thus, the organism is not as
directly involved in the causal connection as a thing that is pushed and
pushed again; instead, it lives between two false units of multiple
mediations. It receives the multiplicity emitted by the unified thing
with its senses, unites it somehow, and then acts back on the thing's
events through an assortment. This peculiar causal connection makes new
connections and relationships between things possible. In the
individual, if you can see through something, you can run your hand
through it without resistance. What is *something* to our eyes is also
*something* in the larger sense. Waves can, therefore, mediate the
knowledge of significant things. This relationship of mediation to what
is mediated, which we found in the wave event, now applies generally to
knowledge transfer.

•

I tried to condense Heider's essay but wanted to retain his originality.
So, I feel it is needed to sum up:

Things are not things per se, and media are not media per se. Everything
can also be a medium for another. A thing is perceptible in a medium
that mediates this perception. Because the thing owes its existence to
perception, which is only possible through the medium, no thing can be
outside of a medium. Media are thus always something in between and move
between other things.

Heider highlights the medial concept, including its effects, but
simultaneously subjects it to an economy that banishes the potential
threat of the medial to the form of the human being (Heider) or the
system (Luhmann).[^12_Treske_Ch8_8]

The ancient elements are media insofar as things appear in them. But the
things are not substances, but *false units*, insofar as the *wave
events* are configured in perception as objects. (Glass, for example,
can be *seen* as a thing or, as a medium, can *let other things see*.)
This is constructivism in its most radical and at the same time most
anthropological variant.[^12_Treske_Ch8_9]

We don’t perceive the transmission channel.

**DIGITAL OBJECTS**

Technological objects constantly evolve to match their time period, with
digital objects currently changing at an especially rapid pace. Yuk Hui
examines digital objects, which he defines as things that appear on
screens or operate in computer programs. Data itself becomes
materialized as objects. Hui’s work draws heavily from philosophers like
Stiegler, Husserl, Simondon, and Heidegger. A key concept is Simondon's
idea of *concretisation*—how technical objects tend toward an ideal (but
unreachable) natural state that reflects their current era. Hui develops
a method based on Bachelard's *orders of magnitude* to analyze digital
objects from different perspectives. He argues that digital objects
represent a new kind of materiality—not just binary code, but the
material capacity to process data.

Digital objects exist as a distinct category of technical objects that
differ fundamentally from physical objects. They are made up of data and
metadata, structured through relations within digital systems. Digital
objects are not simply virtual representations, but have their own mode
of existence characterized by their relationality; they exist through
networks of relations with other digital objects, users, and technical
systems. These objects are inherently relational; their existence
depends on complex webs of relations between data, protocols,
interfaces, and infrastructures. Unlike physical objects, which have
relative independence, digital objects cannot exist outside their
relations. A key point is that digital objects differ from traditional
technical objects in their temporality; they’re oriented toward the
future, rather than serving as objects of cultural memory.

Digital technology has fundamentally altered our relationship with
reality, time, and memory. This transformation operates on several
levels. Regarding digital objects and reality, there's a complex
interplay between two types of ontology: the technical (dealing with
metadata and knowledge representation) and the existential (concerning
our being-in-the-world). Digital objects exist through both discursive
relations (technical/logical) and existential relations (our lived
experience of them). This dual nature suggests we might be experiencing
an *inauthentic* version of technical reality. Concerning time and
memory, time itself has become quantifiable data—something that can be
measured, controlled, and infinitely divided (albeit with delays). This
transforms how we store and access memories through what Bernard
Stiegler calls *tertiary retention*: our technological memory systems.
Time no longer flows uniformly but exists in different rhythms, scales,
and intensities. And regarding the human-technology relationship, we've
become so intertwined with technology that humans are now *unthinkable*
without their technical supplements. Technology shapes how we form and
retain memories (both immediate and long-term). This relationship has a
*pharmacological* nature - meaning technology acts as both a remedy and
a potential poison.

Digital objects have introduced a new way of being, in which numbers are
material entities subject to control, symbols are transformed through
*de-symbolization*, and our very experience of time and memory is
mediated through technical systems. This isn't just about using
technology - it's about how technology has fundamentally reshaped our
way of existing in the world. We are in a new phase of human evolution.
Digital objects transform our thinking about materiality and our
relationship with technology, producing new forms of social and cultural
memory through their persistence and replicability.

As discussed, we perceive things through transparent media like air or
light; think of how you see an object through air. The medium (air) and
the thing (what you're looking at) are clearly separate. But digital
objects (Hui) work differently. They're both the thing AND the medium at
the same time. Think of a digital photo: it's an object you can look at,
but it's also the means by which information is transmitted.

While traditional media need to be *formless* to carry information (like
clear air letting you see things), digital objects have their own form
while still carrying information. Copying, modifying, or deleting
instantly define different ways of existing and being perceived.

With digital objects, several complex layers of mediation emerge.
There’s the physical infrastructure layer: the hardware, processors,
memory, and network cables that form the material basis for digital
objects. Unlike natural media, these aren't *thing-free,* but are highly
structured and engineered specifically for information transmission.
Then, there's the software layer: the operating systems, protocols, and
code that interpret and translate digital information. This represents a
form of mediation that has no clear parallel in Heider's theory, as it's
both a medium and a set of active processes. And, there's the interface
layer: the screens, speakers, and input devices through which we
actually interact with digital objects. Here we finally return to
something closer to Heider's natural media (light from screens, sound
waves from speakers), but these are already heavily processed and
transformed.

These layers of mediation affect our perception of digital objects as
*real* things. In Heider’s theory, direct perception through natural
media helps establish the reality and permanence of physical objects.
But digital objects are always accessed through this complex chain of
technological mediation, which might suggest they should feel less
*real* to us. Yet paradoxically, digital objects often feel quite real
and present in our experience. Interestingly, while Heider's theory
suggests that multiple layers of mediation should make objects feel more
distant and less real, digital objects often achieve a kind of immediate
presence in our experience despite (or perhaps because of) their complex
mediation.

As digital objects transform our experience of the world, they also
transform our interaction with it. The digital layers upon the physical,
creating an invisible skin of mediation, a *formless* package. The
complexity of hardware, software, interface and network melts into a
thing, mediated and invisible. Our world, our minds perceive with and in
technology. The smartphone as we know it now is just a state of
in-betweenness.
