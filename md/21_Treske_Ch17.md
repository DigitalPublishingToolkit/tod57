LOG:: 16 Intermission - PAUSE

A break? Intermission? Here is a simple etude or basic audiovisual
workout:

**one minute of life**

Instruction: **Record** on any device one continuous minute of your life
as video!

The moment of recording has to be random. Follow an impulse to grab your
devise and press record. Don’t think about it. Don’t frame. Don’t ask.
Just be with the instant feeling, be with the wish to record. And then
wait. Wait one minute. Let the timecode run. **One Minute.** Feel the
duration, the process of time, extending what was an instant urge, but
now is a duty to follow. After one minute you can press stop.

Don’t watch the recording immediately. Let time pass, maybe days, before
you watch it. Have a big screen to view your recording. Press start and
watch it till it stops.

**Play it again.** And maybe again.

What has happened in this one minute of life recorded? What do you see?

If you wish you can gift this one minute to someone.

Repeat this etude frequently!

**Enjoy!**
