LOG:: 08 ABOUT a line

> Wenn ein Punkt Bewegung und Linie wird, so erfordert das Zeit.
>
> Paul Klee

Where to start? Paul calls. No Free Play. Extrabreit. Video is the pure
change of light. The visual starts with a point. The point is on a
plane. The point moves in an ordered structure. Two points make a line.

At the beginning of the history of the moving image, there was a
technological and scientific interest. This interest in technological
advance and invention is about movement and research regarding movement.
A lab set up is built and used: a wall, a horse, a camera, and an
isolated body in movement. The body is the object of interest, the
camera a research instrument. Movement is magic. Movement motivated
Melieres.

The first cameras are also the first projectors. Their separation makes
incredible distances for the reproduction of movement possible in
multiple places far away from each other.

**Scanning**

The technical problem of television was the reproduction of the event
anywhere simultaneously. The trick of scanning line by line as a
principle methodology made it possible. Lines and pixels, points on a
target plane, are a technical condition of transport and time to form
anywhere a grid. After the invention of television, it took many years
to be able to record the analog video image. This was accomplished
through creating the scanned raster of lines and inscribing what
information was present in each line. This was the strategy of analog
video in its two main forms: PAL and NTSC.

While film and cinema are about pictures, photographic images, and lines
as compositional elements inside frames, the electronic system uses
points as targets to scan and reproduce the live event. Movement and
storytelling in cinema are framed and static, while television video and
electronic and digital media are highly dynamic. The high speed of
construction and transformation makes images visible and sound audible.
Two points near each other construct a line. The signal’s scanning
methodology goes by the line, line by line, from top to bottom, and the
attributes or content of the target points on screen, pixels, and visual
information build a line, then building each image.

With digital technology and modern LED screens, scanning became
obsolete. A form of inscribing and recording information that was
independent of the scanned raster but was grid-like, digital in form and
mode, took over. Digital videos structure is pixel-based rather than
line-based, and stores complete frames as data. No physical scanning
beam (only necessary because of the state of magnetic control of
electron beams and glass technology), but compression algorithms.
Displayed instantly as complete frames. Different, aesthetically.

**Two Points**

From one point the world arises, from two points a life that is a
line.[^13_Treske_Ch9_1]

As an essential visual and design element of drawing, the line is both a
technical instrument and an artist's means of expression and style. The
line connects two points; it separates, guides, organizes, draws,
stretches, outlines, and designs or runs in a disorderly, labyrinthine,
undulating manner.

The Italian architect and art historian Manlio Brusatin points to the
myth of Daedalus. The first artist and architect built the labyrinth of
the Minotaur as a symbol of architecture and road building, which in
turn could only be outwitted by the *line* of a string: Ariadne's
thread.

I want to follow Brusatin in an attempt to look again at the screen as a
medium in itself and at the lines and pixels or dots it consists of.
Here, I also insist on an aesthetic approach to something that might
otherwise appear all too technical, or all too ubiquitous.

**Simplex Linea**

Manlio Brusatin writes. Life is a line; thinking is a line, and acting
is a line. Everything is a line. The line connects two points. The point
is a moment; the line begins and ends in two moments. For Euclid, the
line separates itself from the dimension of bodies to be able to control
them. Bodies without dimensions are surfaces. Surfaces without extension
are lines. The ends of lines that have no length are points. Euclid
begins his geometry in reverse.[^13_Treske_Ch9_2]

In classical antiquity, the line expressed clarity and proximity. Under
the influence of Platonism, in the age of humanism, there was a strong
push for the production of images, which were almost entirely replaced
by the religious cultic world of imagery. The line of Platonism is a
whole cosmos, traversed and structured by ascending, descending,
circular, and spiral lines.

When the *optics* of the Middle Ages developed from Arabic optics, a
fundamental problem arose. According to Euclidian geometry, perception
presupposes the existence of an observer whose eye emits rays whose
trajectories are as precisely directed as arrows. Ye according to
optics, committed, as it is, to Platonism, the emanated rays are equal
to the properties of the bodies (species) that emanate from the
*surfaces or shells* that, as Democritus says, cover noble things. The
power of sight is as delicate as a line; like a line, the shorter the
path it travels, the more immediate and sharp it is. For Aristotle, too,
nature operates along the shortest and best possible route: thus, a
straight line. The commentaries of medieval scholastics on Roben
Grosseteste, the Bishop of Lincoln, who saw light as something entirely
material, do, however, see a parallel between lines and direct rays, as
well as between angles and reflected rays (broken lines that change
their trajectory) that strike reflective or even opaque surfaces. The
geometric line, reinforced by the principle of light, is like an arrow
that bounces off and is reflected. This is why vision can no longer be
static, determined by the point of observation. That the ray is subject
to actions such as reflections becomes the established conception of an
optics and theory of vision that extends *geometrically* to Newton and
*psychologically* to Berkeley.[^13_Treske_Ch9_3]

Distance, also a line, can only be determined by the greater or lesser
deviation of the rays from one another, which is a rather simplistic
representation. But this opens up an aspect that was still completely
unknown in the ancient world: the possibility of bringing objects as
close as possible to the subject, which is almost miraculous, because
it:

> shows us how we can, at our will, make very distant things appear very
> close, large things that are close by appear tiny, and small things
> that are far away appear large, so that we can read tiny letters from
> an incredible distance, as if we were counting grains of sand.[^13_Treske_Ch9_4]

These not-yet-entirely apparent considerations inevitably bring to mind
the *modern* invention of spectacles, which would not appear until the
13th century.

It is difficult to say whether it was Platonism or Aristotelianism, with
their respective conceptions of the rays of vision (that they emanate
from objects or rather from the human eye), which prepared the
compositional and representational aspects that were central to the
Italian *prospettiva*, which would later be attributed to Filippo
Brunelleschi (in the material sense) and Leon Battista Alberti (in the
spiritual sense), and which is expressed, for example, in the paintings
of Piero della Francesca.

The two coincide. The Platonist discourse of the Bishop of Brixen,
Nicholas of Cusa, develops its symbolic construction, turning away from
the distant relations of similarity that occupied astronomy, in a
brilliant act of bringing the objects of the world of the sensible
closer together (*De docta ignorantia*, Chapter I). The horizon line is
now one and the same—whether for the Arab world, which crosses deserts
and seas, or for the Italian city, where from a tower top, a point on
the horizon is determined where the vanishing lines converge, but also,
at the same time, *return* from the horizon and arrange themselves on a
targeted baseline closest to the observer.

The results is a visual pyramid or optical cone formed from imaginary
rays, which we might better imagine as something emitted by the viewer's
eye. This scheme for seeing is closer to Euclid and Aristotle. It thus
corresponds to a geometric-physical (and, at the same time, painterly)
*optics;* the development in *De pictura* nevertheless remains somewhat
ambiguous. Of course, perspective in this sense does nothing other than
arrange two visions according to the *concordant oppositorum* taught by
Nicholas of Cusa, by exchanging them with one another. The theoretical
as well as practical success of the *perspectiva artificialis* and,
related to this, its entire symbolic value, is based on the desire for a
permanent close-up view, which is the opposite of the distant and
momentary vision in the Middle Ages: the view of a city or the brief
glimpse of a star or a coat of arms.

For Piero della Francesca, who defines perspective as *things seen from
a distance*, the view, the form, and the lines move from the objects
seen to the eye. But, ultimately, they are

> that place between the eye and the object where things are to be
> represented. \[That is,\] a place where the eye, based on its visual
> rays, represents things according to their proportions and can thereby
> judge their size.[^13_Treske_Ch9_5]

It is true that by solving the riddle of perspective, artists acquired a
new intellectual status and were able to assert themselves socially as
colleagues within the literary world. But in reality, perspective is
more of an emblem, a cipher, far too complicated and at the same time
far too simple, a labyrinth that the artist knows how to traverse only
by secret paths and which he often presents as a marvel to the stern
gaze of his master or despotic patron. It is also clear that the mastery
of central perspective becomes the golden rule, the first true metaphor
of an intellectual function of the arts, a genuine and unique revolution
of the artists against the manifold skills and secrets of medieval
recipe books, against the emblems and color symbolisms of an
iconographic code in which, like an arithmetic book, the hierarchies of
meaning that applied within the limits of the panel painting (but not
outside it) were recorded. Art is not a reflection of social reality but
rather its correction.

Beyond a mimetic function, central perspective (*perspectiva
artificialsi*) brought the author himself, or what could be considered
his intellectual work, to the foreground. Perspective is more of an aid,
a talisman of interpretation, a model that guides the production
techniques of the various arts, and which the painter can use to develop
his new role as interpreter.

Artistic geometry is still developed under the same considerations
discussed before perspective, and only today do we seem to anticipate
the space-time relationship that uses very *geometric lines* (as
mechanical trajectories) to describe the line through a linear equation
as the speed of a point. Leonardo compares the point to time and the
moment. There is, therefore, an immediate similarity between the line
and a *quantity of time,* because just as points mark the beginning and
end of a line, moments are the beginning and end of a period. The hand
that follows and fixes a line grasps time and gives it form: a line
becomes consciousness of a period and, thus, the dimension of an idea
projected by time and, through time, into the *beyond* and perhaps
eternity. At the end of the 16th century, there is a coat of arms motif
(whose imagery is concentrated on a variety of symbols) that conveys
precisely this moral message: a row of dots runs parallel to a line,
extending over the same length, and underneath it is written: *Eternity
is made of moments* (sie ex instantibus aeternitas).[^13_Treske_Ch9_6]

**KANDINSKY KLEE**

Forget about lines as physical things; they are more like the path a
moving point leaves behind. Imagine a single point, perfectly still. A
line is born when this point breaks free, its movement a rebellion
against its static state. This movement is dynamic, a leap from
stillness to action.

The forces driving this transformation can be anything - diverse and
unpredictable. The number and combination of these forces determine the
character of the line. Imagine a *language* of lines, one that speaks
through their variations in tension and direction. Words can't capture
it.

Art, at its most precise, strips away unnecessary details, letting the
inner voice of this line-language resonate. Pure forms become vessels
for vibrant emotions.

For Wassily Kandinsky, lines craved freedom. His abstract art was all
about liberating them from being tied to objects. As a point finds
movement, it creates a *design*, a fundamental structure built on
movement itself.

Similarly, Paul Klee saw lines not as connections, but as organic
growths, like plants sprouting from a point. Every line continuously
evokes new feelings. Remember, movement is the ultimate source.

> like a walker wandering through a park or like a dog without a leash

**QUESTIONS OF WALKING AND SEEING **

In her book *Wanderlust*, Rebecca Solnit draws a fascinating parallel
between walking and the creative process. She compares writing to
carving a new path through the landscape of imagination, where reading
becomes a guided journey alongside the writer.[^13_Treske_Ch9_8] At first glance, both
pathfinding and guided travel seem to rely heavily on sight. Pathmakers
and travelers both need to watch their steps and navigate the terrain.
However, Solnit's analogy goes deeper.

Writing and reading, like walking, involve more than just the visual.
Tim Ingold asks: *What happens when we walk?* He argues that watching
our steps isn't simply about processing visual information like a map.
We engage with the ground beneath our feet, not a mere image of it.
Similarly, when we *look where we are going*, we scan the entire
physical world around us, not just pictures or representations.[^13_Treske_Ch9_9]

In Akira Kurosawa’s *Dreams,* a painter steps into the paintings of Van
Gogh and walks through his landscape.

Reading and writing involve the exercise of both eye and mind, which
must be true of walking. Can we find a way of describing the imaginative
activity that goes on as one walks, reads, or writes, without having to
suppose that it involves the perusal of images? Perhaps it is the very
notion of the image that has to be rethought, away from the idea that
images represent, on another plane, the forms of things in the world;
instead, take the notion of images as place-holders for these things,
which travelers watch out for, and from which they take their direction.
Could it be that images do not stand for things but rather help you find
them?

Should the drawing or painting be understood as a final image to be
inspected and interpreted, as is conventional in visual culture studies,
or should we consider it a node in a matrix of trails to be followed by
observant eyes?

> Are drawings or paintings of things in the world, or are they like
> things in the world, in the sense that we have to find our ways
> through and among them, inhabiting them as we do the world
> itself?[^13_Treske_Ch9_10]

Across cultures and time, in the simplest manner, traditions have
fostered surprisingly similar ways of understanding the world. From
medieval European monks to Aboriginal Australians, these approaches
don't rely solely on spirits (animism) or animal ancestors (totemism).
Instead, they use the physical world—landscapes, artwork, and even
written text—as a bridge to a deeper reality, a connection with
something more profound.

These traditions challenge the modern view that separates imagination
and reality. They suggest that the *mental* and *material* are
interwoven, like countries without borders. This contrasts with the view
of imagination as distinct from the physical world.

Everything we experience, from paintings to nature, walks to written
words, offers a path to understanding a deeper reality. These
experiences are all valid forms of knowledge, shaped by a deeper source
within us, a kind of wellspring of life force.

Medieval monks saw reading and writing as journeys. Mentally traveling
through their writing, they drew upon past experiences and ideas. This
flow of thought was purposeful, allowing for variations in mood and
style.

The 12th-century Benedictine Peter of Celle advised scripture readers to
imagine themselves walking through a landscape. By actively engaging all
their senses, slowing down and speeding up as needed, the reader becomes
a *craftsman using various instruments*, fully immersed in the process
of understanding.[^13_Treske_Ch9_11]

In the Middle Ages, people didn't just read religious texts, they lived
them. Imagine these texts as vast landscapes you could explore on a
pilgrimage. Specific locations became characters and stories from the
Bible. By visiting these places, people felt a real connection to the
narratives and their figures. This immersive approach wasn't limited to
written words. Buildings, too, were designed like intricate texts. Every
detail was intended to inspire thought and contemplation. People didn't
try to grasp everything at once, but rather moved around and pondered
each element. This applied to both reading and viewing art. Images
weren't simply visual, nor were words just concepts; both could be
experienced through a blend of sight and sound. Ultimately, reading and
exploring a landscape weren't so different. Both were journeys of the
mind, offering profound encounters with the world.

> One would *read* the painting as a story, moving around the picture
> space as the events of the narrative unfold.[^13_Treske_Ch9_12]

Wassily Kandinsky took this approach even further. He believed music,
like the works of Mussorgsky, could directly evoke emotions and inner
experiences without depicting specific objects. He saw painting as
achieving the same effect with colors and shapes. He compared the artist
to a musician: colors were the keys, the eye was the hammer striking
them, and the canvas served as a multi-stringed instrument resonating
with feeling.

For Kandinsky, abstraction wasn't about creating empty spaces, but
removing distractions. He aimed to reveal a deeper meaning by stripping
away unnecessary details. This *abstract content* resonated with the
soul, similar to spiritual concepts found across cultures. True art, for
him, wasn't about copying the physical world, but about revealing these
inner truths.

Experiencing art, as Kandinsky did while viewing an exhibition while
listening to Mussorgsky's music, becomes a spiritual journey. We relive
emotions and connect with the creative force that drives everything.

Imagination isn't about creating images of things, but about the
creative force that shapes our world and what we experience in art and
nature. Kandinsky suggests that art and the world itself share a
fundamental structure.

**Thinking like a carpet**

> Once you suspend figurative image making, a world of creativity opens
> up. Large-scale forms, such as figures and narrative, cramp the
> creative energy of the lines and colors that compose them.[^13_Treske_Ch9_14]

In her book *Enfoldment and Infinity*, Laura Marks explores a surprising
connection between Islamic art and contemporary media art. What excites
Marks is the way Islamic artistic abstraction uses non-representational
forms to create a sense of *unnatural* life. Marks argues that these
non-figurative images encourage a unique way of seeing that transcends
the human perspective.

Imagine looking at a carpet. By entering its intricate patterns from any
direction, our own perception becomes a part of creating something new.
This idea—that seeing is an act of unfolding—can be found in the work of
Ibn al-Haytham, a 10th-century Muslim scientist known as Alhazen in the
West. Alhazen, in his book *Treatise on Optics*, proposed a theory of
vision that emphasized active perception. He argued that form isn't
something we simply see; it's a mental construct built by our brains.
This means we need to contemplate what we see to recognize form, using
memory, comparison, and imagination. Ultimately, our understanding is
limited by our senses and is constantly being shaped by our interaction
with the world.

Marks finds a fascinating echo of Alhazen's ideas in the work of French
philosopher Henri Bergson. Bergson's concept of the mind as an active
interpreter of the world influenced Gilles Deleuze, who argued that
perception isn't a mirror reflecting reality, but a process of unfolding
the world based on our unique viewpoint.

Normally, we react instinctively to what we see (food, danger, etc.).
But Bergson suggests that the more time we spend absorbing the world
around us, the more we can perceive. The longer we look, the more we
discover (through sight, sound, smell, taste, etc.). This requires us to
break free from our automatic reactions and truly contemplate what we
see. For example, instead of immediately spearing a charging boar, we
might take a moment to observe its details – its fur, its tusks. In some
ways, this deep contemplation goes against our basic human instincts for
survival, which often demand quick reactions. However, both Alhazen and
Bergson propose that true understanding comes from taking the time to
contemplate what we experience before acting.

Carpets, at their core, are like woven algorithms. From the loom's
grid-like structure to the number of threads per inch, the knot style,
and the overall design, each element involves a set of pre-determined
instructions. These instructions function much like an algorithm, a set
of steps to be followed.

Interestingly, the design itself isn't limited by the carpet's material.
Many carpets draw inspiration from other mediums, like paintings. This
suggests that the *algorithms* carpets execute can be independent of the
material itself. In simpler terms, carpets aren't just about the
material; they express a relationship between the material and the idea
behind it—the algorithm.

Humans weave intention into algorithms, just like carpet weavers. These
creations, far from being cold and emotionless, reflect the choices,
thoughts, and even feelings (and sometimes mistakes) of their makers.

Take, for instance, Ottoman-era Turkish carpets—Ushak carpets, for
example. They feature interlocking medallions in contrasting colors,
each with intricate, swirling patterns, all set on a similarly complex
background. These carpets depict a world within a world, a never-ending
reflection.

Carpet experts sometimes believe the center, the deepest layer,
symbolizes heaven. Often, the designs become more refined as they
approach this *divine* center. In a mystical interpretation, these
carpets could be seen as teaching the illusion of reality, yet revealing
an underlying order to the universe.

So, carpets act as a representation of the cosmos. But even the most
structured, hierarchical ones reveal imperfections where concept meets
reality.

Instead of focusing on figures that we compare ourselves to, *thinking
like a carpet* encourages us to explore how our bodies experience the
world. It's not just about seeing, but also about feeling the design and
patterns around us. The lines and shapes can even create a sense of
movement that we can connect with through touch and sensation.
