# LOG:: 12 Sharpness

> In this language of images, one must lose completely the notion of
> image. The images must exclude the idea of image.
>
> —Robert Bresson, 1997

As video becomes ever more realistic and sharper, it somehow loses
something essential—a certain mystery or illusion present in older media
forms. Unlike the analog television image written line by line, creating
a progressive scanning effect, digital video appears as a complete,
instantaneous image. This fullness, this crystal clarity, can feel
almost unsettling or *unheimlich* (uncanny).

This explains the deliberate addition of softness or *cuteness* to
ultra-sharp digital images. It's as if we are trying to create emotional
distance from the overwhelming clarity of digital video. Think of how
bokeh (that beautiful blur in out-of-focus areas of photographs) has
become not just a technical effect but an aesthetic choice that adds
emotional depth. We are encountering a paradox of clarity and distance.

The streaming era has changed our relationship with moving images in
fundamental ways. While traditional cinema was always experienced
*there*, in specific architectural spaces within cities, streamed
content exists in an immediate *here and now*. This immediacy creates a
kind of closeness that needs to be mediated, softened, or disguised in
some way for comfortable sharing.

The technical evolution reflects this tension. From the 525 or 625
vertical scan lines of early television to today's 4K resolution (3,840
horizontal pixels), we have pursued ever-greater clarity. When Hollywood
transitioned from analog to digital, they needed to jump straight to 4K
imagery because 2K appeared too grainy on large screens. Yet
paradoxically, as our ability to capture and display crystal-clear
images has improved, we continue to develop numerous techniques and
filters to reintroduce blur, softness, and imperfection. There must be
something profound about human perception and emotion: sometimes clarity
needs to be veiled to be truly seen, and precision needs to be softened
to be fully felt. The *unschärfe* (blur) isn't just a technical
imperfection—it's a bridge to emotional connection.

When George Lucas shot Star Wars Episode II in 2002 with the first
digital cinema cameras, he and his crew encountered digital clarity as
one of their essential problems. All of a sudden, smudges and
brushstrokes in the makeup were visible. Lucas needed to use filters to
soften the image and make it less sharp. Sets, costumes and makeup
needed to be more precise and refined. Everything needed to be more
finely detailed.[^16_Treske_Ch13_1]

In 1986, long before digital video became commonplace, an interesting
paradox of image quality emerged during the filming of John Lennon's
*Imagine* music video, as Babette Mangolte notes.[^16_Treske_Ch13_2] Using a prototype
Sony high-definition video camera, the crew obsessed over the image
sharpness on their monitors. However, when transferred to 35mm film,
these *perfectly sharp* electronic images revealed unexpected patterns
of sharpness and softness—quite different from what traditional film
emulsion would produce. The image seemed to exist in two stark states:
either sharp or soft, without the subtle gradations typically found in
film.

This early experience with high-definition video foreshadowed issues
that would later emerge in digital cinema. Take 1995's *Toy Story*, for
example. As the first fully digital feature animation, it exhibited an
almost unnatural total sharpness across the entire frame, lacking the
natural depth-of-field effects we're accustomed to in traditional film.
While later digital animations learned to mimic traditional film
techniques like chiaroscuro and selective focus, there remained
something artificial about digital softness. The hard-edged nature of
pixels always lurked beneath the surface.

Interestingly, many filmmakers today actively avoid the pristine
sharpness of digital video, preferring to manipulate shutter speeds to
create what they call the *film look*, essentially recreating the motion
blur characteristic of traditional film.

While extreme sharpness might seem to prevent the mind from wandering
freely (a quality valued in certain types of cinema), the real challenge
may lie in the digital image's brightness and its collapse of the
distinction between *real time* and *screen time*. Rather than freeing
the mind to wander, this hyper-clarity creates a kind of restlessness -
perhaps explaining why we often seek to soften these too-perfect images.

And then there are the blurred backgrounds in our daily video
conferencing, hiding the wall, the pictures, the shelf, the cafe, hotel
lobby, the transitional space to isolate the head, the face, the
shoulder, the close up…

Clair obscure.

Fig. 13. UTOPIA
> It is not as if the world has not long, long been one in which vast numbers live in dystopian depredation. The horizon is more visible now to many who had thought themselves insulated, if they thought about it at all. And dystopia for some is utopia for others. To repeat something I have said elsewhere, we live in a utopia: it just isn’t ours.
