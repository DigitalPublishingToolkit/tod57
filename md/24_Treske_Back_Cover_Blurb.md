Kokusuz, dokusuz ve ne vaat ettiği belirsiz küçük kübik yumuşak
görüntüsü ile Türk lokumu gibi; ağzınıza attığınızda yumuşacık peltemsi
bir temas, yutarken boğazınızı yakan bir tat ve anında tüm hücrelerinize
yayılan şeker... Parmaklarınızda kalan hafif beyaz pudra şekeri 
artıkları… (Like Turkish delight, with its odorless, textureless and
vaguely promising small cubic soft appearance; a soft, mushy touch when
you put it in your mouth, a taste that burns your throat when you
swallow, and sugar that spreads to all your cells instantly … Light
white powdered sugar residues left on your fingers …)

A deep dive into the world of video and digital aesthetics recalling and
exploring everything from the beauty of instability in video signals
(that wonderful chaos when things glitch) to how we experience video in
our daily lives (even cats watching TV!).

Andreas Treske's *heavens delight* is a collection of logs, notes and
essays exploring the evolving nature of video and its impact on culture,
perception, and technology. In an age of algorithmic automation and
technological advancement, video's ability to convey meaning is as
captivating as it can be fleeting, rendering video ever vital.
