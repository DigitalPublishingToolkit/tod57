# Acknowledgments 

A few words of gratitude. There are traces of many, many people in the
words and thoughts and notes that follow. I couldn’t possibly list all
the names; maybe a list of places is better (Wilnsdorf, Siegen, Munich,
Ankara and Amsterdam), or projects (SFB Fernsehen, Rural Europe, PASO,
Video Vortex, *Manti ve Cay*). To everyone I met and talked with about
video and art and more: to my teachers, students, friends, and to
everyone in passage.

My heartfelt gratitude to Geert Lovink, Aras Ozgün, and Lale Gülden
Treske. Thank you.

Many thanks to Will Day for looking over my notes and fragmented
writing.

Thanks also to Melih Aydınat for processing my images.

This text is dedicated to the memory of Ingo Florian Schiller, who
always asked me *how did you mean that,* and made me listen to the
newest electronic music records.
